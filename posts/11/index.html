  <div class="entry-content"><p>Debian Etch has been serving me well for a few years with wonderfully easy and infrequent maintenance.</p>

<p>However it&rsquo;s at the end of its life</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100121">http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100121</a></p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve upgraded to Lenny following these instructions</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html">http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html</a></p>

<p>It was remarkably painless</p>

<p>One small problem with the mail system.</p>

<p><code>
Errors were encountered while processing:
 exim4-config
 imapproxy
 exim4-base
 exim4-daemon-light
 courier-imap
 at
 bsd-mailx
 courier-imap-ssl
 mailx
</code></p>

<p>But scrolling upwards I got a more helpful error message</p>

<p><code>
A package failed to install.  Trying to recover:
Setting up exim4-config (4.69-9) &hellip;
DEBCONFsomethingDEBCONF found in exim configuration. This is most probably
caused by you upgrading to exim4 4.67-3 or later without accepting the
suggested conffile changes. Please read
/usr/share/doc/exim4-config/NEWS.Debian.gz for 4.67-2 and 4.67-4
</code></p>

<p>So I purged exim, deleted the config files, reinstalled it and now everything seems good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Drupal has a fairly easy to meet set of requirements http://drupal.org/node/502452 
</p>


<p>
But Drupal projects are free to set their own rules in this area and Drush has used functions only available in PHP 5.2 - as far as I can see this is just the json functions.
</p>


<p>
Frustratingly the latest version of RedHat provides PHP 5.1 and this is the second time I&#8217;ve run into the problem with a client who uses RedHat and understandably wants to stick to the standard packages.
</p>


<p>
Drush provides command line access to Drupal functions and so is incredibly useful - but not quite critical enough for a platform re-evaluation. 
</p>


<p>
Since my project was using a JSON class anyway I decided to get Drush working using this class instead of requiring PHP 5.1

I&#8217;ve been using version control for a long time, but I haven&#8217;t used CVS much since the first day I tried Subversion.
</p>


<p>
(Git seems great but isn&#8217;t the same kind of drop-in upgrade that CVS to Subversion was)
</p>


<p>
Things I forgot
</p>


<ul>
    <li>CVS doesn&#8217;t do the nice recursive add that subversion does<br />
    At the start of a project you need to run <br />
    cvs import </li>
    <li>CVS expands keywords by default - this is a problem if like me you want to merge in changes from someone else CVS repository as both sites have changes teh keywords<br />
    Disable keyword changing by updating with<br />
    cvs up -d -ko</li>
    <li>CVS doesn&#8217;t add back deleted directories<br />
    cvs up -d </li>
    <li>CVS doesn&#8217;t have a nice equivilant of svn status<br />
    cvs -q up <br />
    Not quite the same as it will update stuff - but it does tell you which local files have changed</li>
    <li>Tagging seems OK but doesn&#8217;t quite do the same thing<br />
    cvs tag</li>

I seem to be progressivly going Google, it started with search but for a long time I resisted the lure of Googles other treats.
</p>


<p>
However since I got an Android phone I&#8217;ve been getting slowly sucked in with accounts on Gmail, Picassa, Google, Calender, and now Google Apps 
</p>


<p>
One thing I found out is that you <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Apps/thread?tid=5e6502d85823b15f&amp;hl=en&amp;fid=5e6502d85823b15f000479078747d294">can&#8217;t upgrade from a Gmail account to a Google Apps one</a> what you have to do is create a new account and do a lot of exporting/importing.
</p>


<p>
A Google apps account allows you to use your own domain name for email, and manage all accounts at that domain but is otherwise not so different to a Gmail account.
</p>


<p>
The lack of upgrade path is a pain but the actual account creation and migration process was easy; I had my email going to the new account within half an hour.
</p>


<p>
The next snag was updating my Android phone to use the new account; there is no obvious way to do this but a bit of googling gave me the answer:
</p>


<p>
Go to Setting &gt; Application &gt; Manage Application 
</p>


<p>
Then for each of 
</p>


<ul>
    <li>Gmail</li>
    <li>Gmail storage</li>
    <li>Google apps</li>
    <li>Google search</li>
</ul>


<p>
&quot;clear data&quot;
</p>


<p>
You should shortly be prompted to enter your new account details.
</p>


<p>
Make sure you have imported your contacts and calender to the new account before doing this so that your cleared data gets restored quickly.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I recently bought a Sony e-reader, the main Linux package to support this is calibre but I found that it wouldn&#8217;t automatically sync my ebooks.
</p>


<p>
 <a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/user_manual/faq.html#what-devices-does-app-support">The FAQ says </a>
</p>


<p>
 &quot;The linux kernel can export two version of SYSFS, one of which is deprecated.&quot;
</p>


<p>
Apparently Debian Lenny exports the deprecated version and you have to recompile the kernel to undo this.
</p>


<p>
I wanted to make the minimum change possible to my system and continue using the packaging system : I follwed roughly the following steps:
</p>


<p><code>
sudo aptitude install kernel-package ncurses-dev fakeroot wget bzip2 linux-source-2.6.26
mkdir ~/linux
cd ~/linux
tar -xjf /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.26.tar.bz2
cd linux-source-2.6.26
cp /boot/config-2.6.26-2-686 .config
make menuconfig
</code></p>

<p><p>
In the config menu I selected
<pre>
General setup &ndash;>
         [] Create deprecated sysfs layout for older userspace tools
</pre>
<p>And made sure I specified a custom revision to differentiate my custom package from the standard one</p></p>

<p><code>
make-kpkg &ndash;rootcmd fakeroot &ndash;initrd &ndash;revision=custom.001 kernel_image kernel_headers
cd ..
sudo dpkg -i linux*deb
</code></p>

<p><p>Then reboot ensuring the new kernel is loaded.</p></p>

<p><p>I meant to write this up as I went but I&rsquo;m doing it a few days later so please take care if following them - and adjust to suit your kernel version etc.<p></p>

<p><p>The above sounds like a pain but was actually fairly easy, and calibre is much better than the official Sony software which I tried on a Windows machine but it was slow and kept crashing.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><p>Drupal has a lot of great strengths and some weaknesses<p></p>

<p><p>The following are the key areas of Drupal that (as a programmer) I would like to see improved.<p></p>

<p><h2>
Negative testing 
</h2>
<p>
Drupal only seems to
test the positive path, that is that given the right inputs you get
the right results and apart from security nothing else matters.
</p>
<p>
The result of this is
that incorrect inputs result in silent failures that can be very hard
to debug.
</p>
<p>
By testing that
incorrect inputs also provide dependable results with clear error
messages bug fixing becomes much easier and development time can be
reduced.
</p>
<p>
Of course it isn&rsquo;t
possible top test for all possible bad inputs – but just catching
some of the likely errors can be very helpful.
</p>
<h2>Database abstraction</h2>
<p>
If Drupal (and
contributed modules) could provide functions to manage their data,
thereby removing the need for developers to either access data
directly or work via the GUI – then many development tasks would
become easier.
</p>
<p>
This would have
particular benefit for the deployment of upgrades to large sites as
all the changes could be written into update hooks.
</p>
<h2>Stronger encapsulation</h2>
<p>
I find it particularly
noticeable when writing “unit” tests for Drupal that the
encapsulation could be stronger. Pervasive use of globals, direct
database access, and static variables for caching make it very hard
to test Drupal at the unit level – most tests end up running at the
integration level which while still useful is much slower and harder
to integrate into the regular development cycle (code, test, repeat –
then commit).
</p>
<h2>Upgrades with backwards compatibility</h2>
<p>
Major Drupal upgrades
are not compatible, and minor upgrades don&rsquo;t add features.
</p>
<p>
The biggest impact this
has had on me and other professional developers I know is that it
removes the main incentive to contribute – namely to fix problems
in Drupal projects currently in progress.
</p>
<h2>Define hooks</h2>
<p>
“<a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/group/hooks">A hook is a PHP
function that is named foo_bar()</a>”
</p>
<p>
Well I know that, and I
know how to use them and even create new ones – but I think a more
complete definition would help clarify the purpose of hooks and
perhaps more importantly better named hooks would provide the
developer with a better idea of when hooks are called.
</p>
<p>
I think that hooks
probably provide more than one service, some hooks are really event
handlers (hook_cron() hook_validate() ) others are a kind of
interface (hook_view(), hook_update(), hook_insert() etc).
</p>
<p>
If you think of
hook_form_alter() as an event handler rather than for what work is
typically done at that event you might rename it hook_form_build()
which might help developers learn when it is fired and also provide
hints as to other ways it might be used (eg you could use it to log
the number of times a form is displayed on a site).
</p>
<h2>Separate the toolkit from the components</h2>
<p>
I love the way that
drush isn&rsquo;t a Drupal module, its independent of production code – I
think it would be great of more tools provided this ability.
</p>
<p>
 With a
strong API it would even be possible to use just the API of something
like CCK and remove the GUI entirely from production – thus
removing one way that a client who demands the admin password can
break the site.
</p>
<h2>Choose
a target</h2>
<p>
Drupal
tries to be all things to everyone: but this isn&rsquo;t possible.
</p>
<p>
I
don&rsquo;t think you can have a product that runs on low end servers with
out of date versions of PHP, works the same on any database (even
SQLite) and still meets the needs of enterprise level teams.
</p>
<p>
Drupal
needs to pick a target and focus on that – otherwise other products
will come along and do a much better job for specific sectors of the
market.
</p>
<p>
It
seems like there is a <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/designing-for-the-wrong-target-audience/">similar issue with the user interface
</a>
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Generally I&rsquo;d like to see a much tighter Drupal with more focus on best practise and a clean API.</p></p>

<p><p>Whether that is what the rest of the Drupal community wants is another thing.</p></p>

The new layout uses Flash to render the pages as they look in print in a scrollable window.
</p>


<p>
I hate this because
</p>


<ul>
    <li>I work on a widescreen laptop with development toolbars and tabs in my browser - this layout of a tall thin view just doesn&#8217;t fit on my screen.</li>
    <li>I can&#8217;t scroll the Safari menu and banner offscreen </li>
    <li>Most of the time I don&#8217;t care too much about formatting I just want to read it and HTML is easier to read</li>
    <li>The scrolling doesn&#8217;t respond to my mousewheel</li>
    <li>I like to get a nice big page of text onscreen and the use the browsers search to quickly home in on the bit I want to read. </li>
</ul>


<p>Oh well - back to books for now and another incentive to try and get the perfect ereader&hellip;</p>
