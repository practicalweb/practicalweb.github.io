  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I seem to be progressivly going Google, it started with search but for a long time I resisted the lure of Googles other treats.
</p>


<p>
However since I got an Android phone I&#8217;ve been getting slowly sucked in with accounts on Gmail, Picassa, Google, Calender, and now Google Apps 
</p>


<p>
One thing I found out is that you <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Apps/thread?tid=5e6502d85823b15f&amp;hl=en&amp;fid=5e6502d85823b15f000479078747d294">can&#8217;t upgrade from a Gmail account to a Google Apps one</a> what you have to do is create a new account and do a lot of exporting/importing.
</p>


<p>
A Google apps account allows you to use your own domain name for email, and manage all accounts at that domain but is otherwise not so different to a Gmail account.
</p>


<p>
The lack of upgrade path is a pain but the actual account creation and migration process was easy; I had my email going to the new account within half an hour.
</p>


<p>
The next snag was updating my Android phone to use the new account; there is no obvious way to do this but a bit of googling gave me the answer:
</p>


<p>
Go to Setting &gt; Application &gt; Manage Application 
</p>


<p>
Then for each of 
</p>


<ul>
    <li>Gmail</li>
    <li>Gmail storage</li>
    <li>Google apps</li>
    <li>Google search</li>
</ul>


<p>
&quot;clear data&quot;
</p>


<p>
You should shortly be prompted to enter your new account details.
</p>


<p>
Make sure you have imported your contacts and calender to the new account before doing this so that your cleared data gets restored quickly.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I recently bought a Sony e-reader, the main Linux package to support this is calibre but I found that it wouldn&#8217;t automatically sync my ebooks.
</p>


<p>
 <a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/user_manual/faq.html#what-devices-does-app-support">The FAQ says </a>
</p>


<p>
 &quot;The linux kernel can export two version of SYSFS, one of which is deprecated.&quot;
</p>


<p>
Apparently Debian Lenny exports the deprecated version and you have to recompile the kernel to undo this.
</p>


<p>
I wanted to make the minimum change possible to my system and continue using the packaging system : I follwed roughly the following steps:
</p>


<p><code>
sudo aptitude install kernel-package ncurses-dev fakeroot wget bzip2 linux-source-2.6.26
mkdir ~/linux
cd ~/linux
tar -xjf /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.26.tar.bz2
cd linux-source-2.6.26
cp /boot/config-2.6.26-2-686 .config
make menuconfig
</code></p>

<p><p>
In the config menu I selected
<pre>
General setup &ndash;>
         [] Create deprecated sysfs layout for older userspace tools
</pre>
<p>And made sure I specified a custom revision to differentiate my custom package from the standard one</p></p>

<p><code>
make-kpkg &ndash;rootcmd fakeroot &ndash;initrd &ndash;revision=custom.001 kernel_image kernel_headers
cd ..
sudo dpkg -i linux*deb
</code></p>

<p><p>Then reboot ensuring the new kernel is loaded.</p></p>

<p><p>I meant to write this up as I went but I&rsquo;m doing it a few days later so please take care if following them - and adjust to suit your kernel version etc.<p></p>

<p><p>The above sounds like a pain but was actually fairly easy, and calibre is much better than the official Sony software which I tried on a Windows machine but it was slow and kept crashing.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><p>Drupal has a lot of great strengths and some weaknesses<p></p>

<p><p>The following are the key areas of Drupal that (as a programmer) I would like to see improved.<p></p>

<p><h2>
Negative testing 
</h2>
<p>
Drupal only seems to
test the positive path, that is that given the right inputs you get
the right results and apart from security nothing else matters.
</p>
<p>
The result of this is
that incorrect inputs result in silent failures that can be very hard
to debug.
</p>
<p>
By testing that
incorrect inputs also provide dependable results with clear error
messages bug fixing becomes much easier and development time can be
reduced.
</p>
<p>
Of course it isn&rsquo;t
possible top test for all possible bad inputs – but just catching
some of the likely errors can be very helpful.
</p>
<h2>Database abstraction</h2>
<p>
If Drupal (and
contributed modules) could provide functions to manage their data,
thereby removing the need for developers to either access data
directly or work via the GUI – then many development tasks would
become easier.
</p>
<p>
This would have
particular benefit for the deployment of upgrades to large sites as
all the changes could be written into update hooks.
</p>
<h2>Stronger encapsulation</h2>
<p>
I find it particularly
noticeable when writing “unit” tests for Drupal that the
encapsulation could be stronger. Pervasive use of globals, direct
database access, and static variables for caching make it very hard
to test Drupal at the unit level – most tests end up running at the
integration level which while still useful is much slower and harder
to integrate into the regular development cycle (code, test, repeat –
then commit).
</p>
<h2>Upgrades with backwards compatibility</h2>
<p>
Major Drupal upgrades
are not compatible, and minor upgrades don&rsquo;t add features.
</p>
<p>
The biggest impact this
has had on me and other professional developers I know is that it
removes the main incentive to contribute – namely to fix problems
in Drupal projects currently in progress.
</p>
<h2>Define hooks</h2>
<p>
“<a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/group/hooks">A hook is a PHP
function that is named foo_bar()</a>”
</p>
<p>
Well I know that, and I
know how to use them and even create new ones – but I think a more
complete definition would help clarify the purpose of hooks and
perhaps more importantly better named hooks would provide the
developer with a better idea of when hooks are called.
</p>
<p>
I think that hooks
probably provide more than one service, some hooks are really event
handlers (hook_cron() hook_validate() ) others are a kind of
interface (hook_view(), hook_update(), hook_insert() etc).
</p>
<p>
If you think of
hook_form_alter() as an event handler rather than for what work is
typically done at that event you might rename it hook_form_build()
which might help developers learn when it is fired and also provide
hints as to other ways it might be used (eg you could use it to log
the number of times a form is displayed on a site).
</p>
<h2>Separate the toolkit from the components</h2>
<p>
I love the way that
drush isn&rsquo;t a Drupal module, its independent of production code – I
think it would be great of more tools provided this ability.
</p>
<p>
 With a
strong API it would even be possible to use just the API of something
like CCK and remove the GUI entirely from production – thus
removing one way that a client who demands the admin password can
break the site.
</p>
<h2>Choose
a target</h2>
<p>
Drupal
tries to be all things to everyone: but this isn&rsquo;t possible.
</p>
<p>
I
don&rsquo;t think you can have a product that runs on low end servers with
out of date versions of PHP, works the same on any database (even
SQLite) and still meets the needs of enterprise level teams.
</p>
<p>
Drupal
needs to pick a target and focus on that – otherwise other products
will come along and do a much better job for specific sectors of the
market.
</p>
<p>
It
seems like there is a <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/designing-for-the-wrong-target-audience/">similar issue with the user interface
</a>
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Generally I&rsquo;d like to see a much tighter Drupal with more focus on best practise and a clean API.</p></p>

<p><p>Whether that is what the rest of the Drupal community wants is another thing.</p></p>

I&#8217;ve had an account with O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari books</a> on and off for years
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ve cancelled it before beacuase of design issues that rendered it unworkable for me.
</p>


<p>
This time they have &quot;upgraded&quot; the site from an AJAX based layout which allowed me to choose between &quot;print fidelity&quot; and &quot;HTML view&quot;.
</p>


<p>
The new layout uses Flash to render the pages as they look in print in a scrollable window.
</p>


<p>
I hate this because
</p>


<ul>
    <li>I work on a widescreen laptop with development toolbars and tabs in my browser - this layout of a tall thin view just doesn&#8217;t fit on my screen.</li>
    <li>I can&#8217;t scroll the Safari menu and banner offscreen </li>
    <li>Most of the time I don&#8217;t care too much about formatting I just want to read it and HTML is easier to read</li>
    <li>The scrolling doesn&#8217;t respond to my mousewheel</li>
    <li>I like to get a nice big page of text onscreen and the use the browsers search to quickly home in on the bit I want to read. </li>
</ul>


<p>Oh well - back to books for now and another incentive to try and get the perfect ereader&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Drupal is a very
flexible CMS which can be extended to provide the functionality
needed for may different types of website.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ve worked on a few
projects where I was brought in for my Drupal expertise, but in the
end felt that Drupal wasn&#8217;t a good solution in these particular
circumstances. So I&#8217;ve been pondering what sorts of projects is
Drupal best suited to.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;m not thinking about
small brochureware websites that might be best managed using
Wordpress, Joomla or the like as almost all my experience is of
larger projects where the alternatives are frameworks such as
Symfony, Rails, Struts etc – or pure custom code. 
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;m know it&#8217;s possible
to run a successful Drupal project that doesn&#8217;t have all the good
points and does have some bad points from the lists below – I&#8217;ve
done it.
</p>


<p>
But if anyone has
successfully delivered a regularly upgraded, high traffic, fully
tested web application with inflexible requirements using a large
team of OO programmers with little prior Drupal experience – well
I&#8217;d love to hear about it.
</p>


<h2>Drupal Positives</h2>


<ul>
    <li>
    Small team
    </li>
    <li>
    Drupal experience
    </li>
    <li>
    There is a maintenance plan 
    </li>
    <li>
    A single release
    </li>
    <li>
    Flexible specifications
    </li>
    <li>
    Content Oriented
    </li>
    <li>
    Greenfield project
    </li>
    <li>
    Moderate traffic
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Drupal Negatives</h2>


<ul>
    <li>
    Large team
    </li>
    <li>
    Minimal Drupal experience
    </li>
    <li>
    OO skills
    </li>
    <li>
    No/low maintenance budget
    </li>
    <li>
    Regular upgrade cycle 
    </li>
    <li>
    Inflexible requirements
    </li>
    <li>
    Web Application
    </li>
    <li>
    AJAX heavy
    </li>
    <li>
    High traffic
    </li>
    <li>
    Testing a high priority
    </li>
    <li>
    Legacy systems integration
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Team Size</h2>


<p>
I spent a year working on a Drupal project that
had about 15 developers, plus test team, designers, project
management etc.
</p>


<p>
It&#8217;s possible, but with this size team we ran into
several problems.
</p>


<p>
In order to compose modules, content types, views,
blocks, menus etc to build useful functionality the developer
effectively works in the database a lot of the time. With small team
it is possible to share a database so that work done there can be
promoted directly to live just by selecting the required tables, with
a large team sharing the database would lead to too much downtime
(introduce a bad configuration and you have 14 people waiting for you
to fix it).
</p>


<p>
Databases aren&#8217;t easy to version control –
especially when you need to take into account auto increment fields
so you don&#8217;t get conflicting IDs when merging work from several
developers.
</p>


<p>
Drupal&#8217;s install and update hooks can be useful
but they are targeted more at distribution than team synchronisation.
</p>


<p>
Generally we fond that the Drupal hook system
provides power without restraint – making it all too easy for a
module to implement something like hook_form_alter() in a way that
subtly breaks the behavior of an unrelated module elsewhere. 
</p>


<h2>Drupal vs OO experience</h2>


<p>
I&#8217;ve worked with some developers that love Drupal
some that didn&#8217;t know it, and others that hate it. It&#8217;s all to easy
when selecting a new technology to get carried away by the
possibilities, but don&#8217;t forget technologies don&#8217;t build websites –
people do.
</p>


<p>
“<em>For the overwhelming majority of the
bankrupt projects we studied, there was not a single technological
issue to explain the failure.” </em> 
<a href="/review/peopleware">Peopleware</a>
</p>


<p>
If your team
hates Drupal and loves OO then be very careful about selecting it for
your project, conversely if you&#8217;re  Drupal shop full of experienced
Drupal developers you can probably get away with using Drupal when
it&#8217;s outrageously unsuited to the task.
</p>


<h2>Maintenance</h2>


<p>
Any website
complex enough to consider using Drupal is going to need some
maintenance, but I am surprised by the frequency of Drupal updates
that need to be applied to keep the site secure.
</p>


<p>
I have written
applications without the benefit of a framework or CMS that after the
first month or two neither needed nor received any development work
for a period of years. I worked for a long time on an application
that has now run for seven years – during which time you might see
three or four incompatible Drupal versions released.
</p>


<p>
Security releases
are in general a good thing, and Drupal support is not short term so
this may not be a major concern for many projects – but Drupal is
not a “fire and forget” solution.
</p>


<h2>Release
Frequency</h2>


<p>
Deployment is
well accepted as being one of Drupal&#8217;s weaknesses 
</p>


<p>
&quot;<em>Deployment of code, content, and configuration changes continue to be one of the big challenges in Drupal</em>&quot; <a href="http://association.drupal.org/Building-redesign-community-infrastructure-Administrators-wanted">Kieran Lal</a> 
</p>


<p>
If your project
is something you build, test, release, and finish: then deployment
isn&#8217;t a problem.
</p>


<p>
If you need to
apply verified patches to fix bugs, while rolling out major upgrades
every couple of months: I can tell you from bitter experience that
Drupal can be a challenge.
</p>


<h2>Flexible
Specifications</h2>


<p>
Drupal can help
you develop functionality very quickly by using existing modules. But
these modules will already have an interface and a certain way of
doing things; if you can be flexible in the interpretation of
requirements then Drupal can be great. However if your project has to
meet specific client expectations and Drupal doesn&#8217;t work quite that
way you may find yourself working very hard to alter Drupal to fit. 
</p>

</p>


<h2>Content Site or Web Application</h2>


<p>
Drupal is a very flexible CMS, and you can build
other things with it, but I don&#8217;t think it qualifies as a framework
and so I wouldn&#8217;t use it in that way to create an application.
</p>


<p>
Drupal has a very thin database layer, it doesn&#8217;t
separate  the MVC components very well (theme, menu and model
functions all in the same module), and there are many holes in the
Drupal API.
</p>


<p>
On the other hand Drupal has a lot of content
oriented tools so if your project needs these it may well save a lot
of development time.

<h2>Greenfield or Legacy Integration</h2>


<p>
Drupal requires a certain database structure, with
even less flexibility if you use CCK if you already have a database
structure which you can&#8217;t change it would be difficult to use Drupal.
You can integrate existing databases with Drupal but everyone I&#8217;ve
spoken to who has done this has ended up writing an import routine
that converts existing data into Drupal nodes, even if this involves
loading and submitting thousands of virtual Drupal forms.
</p>


<h2>AJAX</h2>


<p>
I&#8217;ve just finished a project which made heavy use
of AJAX, and I was surprised to find that Drupal did very little to
facilitate this and that I had to <a href="http://www.drupaler.co.uk/blog/naming-form-items-drupal/429">work around some problems</a>.
</p>


<p>
Sure you can do AJAX in Drupal – but if you&#8217;re
going to be doing a lot of AJAX you might want to use a framework
that targets this.
</p>


<h2>Traffic levels</h2>


<p>
Drupal is resource intensive, CCK and Views can
hit the database pretty hard, Drupal&#8217;s hook system gives you
flexibility but you pay for this by allowing each module to act
separately on the same event when a single action might be more
efficient.
</p>


<p>
If you throw enough hardware at Drupal you can
make it scale massively as Comic Relief does to notable effect –
but they do have to do a lot of work synchronising data and assets to
make this work.   
</p>


<p>
For sites with a normal amount of traffic Drupal
will be just fine anyway.
</p>


<h2>Testing</h2>


<p>
I&#8217;ve used Drupal&#8217;s test framework where I can and
it&#8217;s clearly been important in the development of Drupal 7 – but I
don&#8217;t see it being used by developers day to day. I think this is
because Drupal isn&#8217;t very test friendly. Any function may use the
database at any point, functions cache data internally, global
variables are used – tests are hard to isolate and run slowly.
</p>


<p>
For many websites rigorous testing isn&#8217;t a
priority – but if it is there many frameworks offer strong support
for testing throughout development which may be helpful.
</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>
I hope people find these thoughts useful, they are
only intended as pointers based on my experience.
</p>


<p>
Many Drupal projects will succeed which have some
of the bad points listed above, just as other projects which could be
very good candidates for Drupal will succeed even if built using
other tools.
</p>


<p>
But if anyone has heard of Drupal success stories
that have none of my good points and all of the bad ones – please
do let me know about it.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I&#8217;ve been working in the CMS arena for 10 years, and the whole time I&#8217;ve been expecting one or more “industry standard” CMS&#8217;s to come along, but instead we&#8217;ve seen thousands of competing products with almost every web agency claiming to have CMS product.
</p>


<p>
While development costs have come down a long way due to greater experience and code re-use they still haven&#8217;t come down anywhere close to the level that people are used to from purchasing shrink-wrapped mass market software.
</p>


<p>
<strong>
Clients have been getting fed up of high costs and vendor lock-in.</strong>
</p>


<p>
In this context I&#8217;ve seen many clients specifying Drupal as a requirement when putting projects out to tender – in the hope of saving cost and avoiding lock in.
</p>


<p>
<strong>
</strong>It&#8217;s really exciting to see an open source project taking on this role.
</p>


<p>
However, having used Drupal on projects like this for the last couple of years I have to question whether it actually fits the bill.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Drupal has ben seen to promise a standard solution</strong> such that if the current development team were run over by the proverbial bus any other team familiar with Drupal could be parachuted in and pick up where the previous lot left off.
</p>


<p>
Having taken over quite a few projects in my time (both Drupal and others) I have to say that I haven&#8217;t found the Drupal projects any easier to pick up. 
</p>


<p>
Drupal does offer a large amount of code that other developers may be familiar with but Drupal is very flexible, one Drupal website can be very different from the next.
</p>


<p>
Drupal does not follow many common programming conventions and experienced developers faced with Drupal for the first time sometimes resort to some ugly solutions because “the Drupal way” is not an obvious one.
</p>


<p>
<strong>I&#8217;d certainly rather take over a &#8216;custom&#8217; project that followed best practise than a Drupal project that&#8217;s been put together by a team that didn&#8217;t know what they were doing.</strong>
</p>


<p>
If you want to keep your development team up to date, able to work on other systems and ready for future changes in technology – then Drupal&#8217;s idiosyncratic patterns are a barrier to be considered. There is a danger that they will spend their time learning Drupal, rather than gaining experience of programming (OO, design patterns etc) that is more likely to be applicable on other systems or even in other programming languages.
</p>


<p>
<strong>A Drupal project only remains standard if it can be implemented with relatively little customisation, otherwise Drupal&#8217;s idiocyncratic programming practises together with heavy reliance of the database for composition and integration of modules can rapidly erode the benefits of standardisation.  </strong>
</p>


<p>
There is also the problem that Drupal releases are not compatible with each other, each new release is in effect a completely new product. There is enough commonality between releases that the development team does not have to learn a whole new system from scratch (though there is significant re-learning required). However clients may easily find themselves with an out of date system, or facing an expensive &#8216;upgrade&#8217; process.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;m reflecting my own experience here, which has all been on highly customised Drupal installations with either a lot of custom functionality or unusual design requirements. I&#8217;ve picked up quite a few Drupal projects part way through.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;m sure that for more standard websites which can use readily available modules Drupal can offer a good degree of standardisation.
</p>


<p>
<strong>The point I would like to make is that Drupal is not a silver bullet for standardisation – you still need to take care to ensure that Drupal is actually a good fit for your project, that the team know what they are doing, and that best practises are adhered to.</strong><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I was originally excited about the embrace that Drupal seemed to have given to testing.
</p>


<p>
However after spending some time with it I&#8217;ve concluded that Drupal really isn&#8217;t very test friendly.
</p>


<p>
Most tests for Drupal are integration tests not unit tests.
</p>


<p>
That is to say that they test a bunch of components together - not each bit separately.
</p>


<p>
This is because Drupal components (modules or functions) are not well encapsulated, global variables are used, data is cached within functions,  passed via the database etc.  
</p>


<p>
THis makes it much harder for the developer to create tests that validate functional increments, and means the suite of tests run very slowly.
</p>


<p>
A while ago I tried to run the tests for Drupal 7 - but gave up waiting after an hour. I was very surprised to find that both database and web server were being hit hard - when I was running on the command line!
</p>


<p>
Even the integration level testing isn&#8217;t all that great, it runs in an environment without JavaScript support - so the AJAX functionality can&#8217;t be tested. 
</p>


<p>
Testing is better than not testing - but having gotten into testing I&#8217;ve found Drupal&#8217;s environment frustrating.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I&#8217;ve been using Drupal for a couple of years now, and know my way around it pretty well.
</p>


<p>
One of my biggest frustrations though is that it doesn&#8217;t really have an API.
</p>


<p>
Much of the functionality is only really available through the application, you can do things pretty easily by pointing and clicking, but try and automate part of this and you have to step through code, find form handlers, copy-paste parts of the functions and work out what parameters are required.
</p>


<p>
The example I found most recently was creating a translated version of a page.
</p>


<p>
My client is using a translation agency, we send them XML, they translate it and return the translated text in XML. 
</p>


<p>
So I start with an English page, send off an XML version, and when I get the XML translation back I need to add a new node related to the original.
</p>


<p>
But Drupal has no function &quot;translation_add()&quot; instead the functionality is embedded in &quot;translation_nodapi()&quot;.
</p>


<p>
If Drupal had an API there would be a well thought out set of functions to add, delete, and update translations of a node.
</p>


<p>
The name of Drupal&#8217;s documentation site http://api.drupal.org/ is misleading, this is just general documentation of Drupal functions, it isn&#8217;t an API.
