  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I&#8217;ve been working in the CMS arena for 10 years, and the whole time I&#8217;ve been expecting one or more “industry standard” CMS&#8217;s to come along, but instead we&#8217;ve seen thousands of competing products with almost every web agency claiming to have CMS product.
</p>


<p>
While development costs have come down a long way due to greater experience and code re-use they still haven&#8217;t come down anywhere close to the level that people are used to from purchasing shrink-wrapped mass market software.
</p>


<p>
<strong>
Clients have been getting fed up of high costs and vendor lock-in.</strong>
</p>


<p>
In this context I&#8217;ve seen many clients specifying Drupal as a requirement when putting projects out to tender – in the hope of saving cost and avoiding lock in.
</p>


<p>
<strong>
</strong>It&#8217;s really exciting to see an open source project taking on this role.
</p>


<p>
However, having used Drupal on projects like this for the last couple of years I have to question whether it actually fits the bill.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Drupal has ben seen to promise a standard solution</strong> such that if the current development team were run over by the proverbial bus any other team familiar with Drupal could be parachuted in and pick up where the previous lot left off.
</p>


<p>
Having taken over quite a few projects in my time (both Drupal and others) I have to say that I haven&#8217;t found the Drupal projects any easier to pick up. 
</p>


<p>
Drupal does offer a large amount of code that other developers may be familiar with but Drupal is very flexible, one Drupal website can be very different from the next.
</p>


<p>
Drupal does not follow many common programming conventions and experienced developers faced with Drupal for the first time sometimes resort to some ugly solutions because “the Drupal way” is not an obvious one.
</p>


<p>
<strong>I&#8217;d certainly rather take over a &#8216;custom&#8217; project that followed best practise than a Drupal project that&#8217;s been put together by a team that didn&#8217;t know what they were doing.</strong>
</p>


<p>
If you want to keep your development team up to date, able to work on other systems and ready for future changes in technology – then Drupal&#8217;s idiosyncratic patterns are a barrier to be considered. There is a danger that they will spend their time learning Drupal, rather than gaining experience of programming (OO, design patterns etc) that is more likely to be applicable on other systems or even in other programming languages.
</p>


<p>
<strong>A Drupal project only remains standard if it can be implemented with relatively little customisation, otherwise Drupal&#8217;s idiocyncratic programming practises together with heavy reliance of the database for composition and integration of modules can rapidly erode the benefits of standardisation.  </strong>
</p>


<p>
There is also the problem that Drupal releases are not compatible with each other, each new release is in effect a completely new product. There is enough commonality between releases that the development team does not have to learn a whole new system from scratch (though there is significant re-learning required). However clients may easily find themselves with an out of date system, or facing an expensive &#8216;upgrade&#8217; process.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;m reflecting my own experience here, which has all been on highly customised Drupal installations with either a lot of custom functionality or unusual design requirements. I&#8217;ve picked up quite a few Drupal projects part way through.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;m sure that for more standard websites which can use readily available modules Drupal can offer a good degree of standardisation.
</p>


<p>
<strong>The point I would like to make is that Drupal is not a silver bullet for standardisation – you still need to take care to ensure that Drupal is actually a good fit for your project, that the team know what they are doing, and that best practises are adhered to.</strong><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I was originally excited about the embrace that Drupal seemed to have given to testing.
</p>


<p>
However after spending some time with it I&#8217;ve concluded that Drupal really isn&#8217;t very test friendly.
</p>


<p>
Most tests for Drupal are integration tests not unit tests.
</p>


<p>
That is to say that they test a bunch of components together - not each bit separately.
</p>


<p>
This is because Drupal components (modules or functions) are not well encapsulated, global variables are used, data is cached within functions,  passed via the database etc.  
</p>


<p>
THis makes it much harder for the developer to create tests that validate functional increments, and means the suite of tests run very slowly.
</p>


<p>
A while ago I tried to run the tests for Drupal 7 - but gave up waiting after an hour. I was very surprised to find that both database and web server were being hit hard - when I was running on the command line!
</p>


<p>
Even the integration level testing isn&#8217;t all that great, it runs in an environment without JavaScript support - so the AJAX functionality can&#8217;t be tested. 
</p>


<p>
Testing is better than not testing - but having gotten into testing I&#8217;ve found Drupal&#8217;s environment frustrating.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I&#8217;ve been using Drupal for a couple of years now, and know my way around it pretty well.
</p>


<p>
One of my biggest frustrations though is that it doesn&#8217;t really have an API.
</p>


<p>
Much of the functionality is only really available through the application, you can do things pretty easily by pointing and clicking, but try and automate part of this and you have to step through code, find form handlers, copy-paste parts of the functions and work out what parameters are required.
</p>


<p>
The example I found most recently was creating a translated version of a page.
</p>


<p>
My client is using a translation agency, we send them XML, they translate it and return the translated text in XML. 
</p>


<p>
So I start with an English page, send off an XML version, and when I get the XML translation back I need to add a new node related to the original.
</p>


<p>
But Drupal has no function &quot;translation_add()&quot; instead the functionality is embedded in &quot;translation_nodapi()&quot;.
</p>


<p>
If Drupal had an API there would be a well thought out set of functions to add, delete, and update translations of a node.
</p>


<p>
The name of Drupal&#8217;s documentation site http://api.drupal.org/ is misleading, this is just general documentation of Drupal functions, it isn&#8217;t an API.

<p>
How much do websites cost? Well it&#8217;s hard to say.
</p>


<p>

</p>


<p>
You&#8217;re gonna have bugs - plan for it and log them so that you can analyse the most common ones and  target your budget effectively.  
</p>


<p>
Developing websites is a real challenge, and putting a business process around it so that all parties make a fair profit is hard too. 
</p>


<p>
But it&#8217;s an exciting business to be in and there are profits to be made.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
When developing Drupal one often needs to pull recent copies of the live database into the dev environment.
</p>


<p>
Loading a dump into the dev database will update any existing tables, add any new ones - but it won&#8217;t remove tables from the dev environment that re not in live.
</p>


<p>
This causes problems with Drupal as module install and update hooks may need to create tables which don&#8217;t yet exist on live. 
</p>


<p>
My solution which assumes you have .my.cnf set up to provide login locally is below.
</p>


<p><code></p>

<h1>dump live db</h1>

<p>ssh live &ldquo;mysqldump livedb | gzip > /tmp/livedb.sql.gz&rdquo;</p>

<h1>download live db</h1>

<p>scp live:/tmp/livedb.sql.gz /tmp</p>

<h1>clean out dev db</h1>

<p>mysql -BNe &ldquo;show tables&rdquo; devdb | awk &lsquo;{print &ldquo;drop table &rdquo; $1 &ldquo;;&rdquo;} | mysql devdb</p>

<h1>copy live db to dev</h1>

<p>zcat /tmp/livedb.sql.gz | mysql devdb</p>

<h1>make sure test mails never go to real users!</h1>

<p>echo &ldquo;update users set mail=&lsquo;<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#x6d;&#101;&#64;&#101;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x6d;&#101;&#x40;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#x6d;&#112;&#108;&#x65;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>&rsquo;&rdquo; | mysql devdb

xdebug is an immensely powerful tool for exploring what your code really does.
</p>


<p>
You can get a long way using print_r  but ultimately this always requires that you predict the path your code will take - and the tricky bit about debugging is you need it when your predications have gone wrong.
</p>


<p>
It&#8217;s generally pretty easy to set up
</p>


<ul>
    <li> install the php5-xdebug package</li>
    <li>check that the Eclipse PHP preferences have xdebug as an option</li>
    <li>if you&#8217;re debugging locally the default settings should be OK</li>
    <li>create a site configuration in the debug dialog</li>
    <li>set a break point</li>
    <li>start debugging</li>
</ul>


<p>
If it doesn&#8217;t work at first restart Eclipse
</p>


<p>
Check that you have a browser configured in Eclipse

Not all settings seem to be picked up immediately
