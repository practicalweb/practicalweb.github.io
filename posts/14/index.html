  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Oh cool :-)
</p>


<p>
I just noticed that selenium IDE has the option to export tests as PHP unit tests.
</p>


<p>
This is great - the IDE is a good way to interactively build up tests by recording a set of actions and tweaking what it records. 
</p>


<p>
And being able to save them as unit tests makes it easy to integrate this with automated testing.
</p>


<p>
Interestingly they are created as PHPunit tests - not simpletest tests.
</p>


<p>
It does look like I&#8217;m being pushed more towards PHPunit - though I wonder how I&#8217;ll integrate this with Drupal development and it&#8217;s focus on simpletest.

I decided to upgrade  VirtualBox because the newer versions have much better support for networks that allow virtual computer to be visible on the real network.
</p>


<p>
But after upgrade I encountered the error
</p>


<p>
&quot;HostInterface&#8217;: The attribute &#8216;name&#8217; is required but missing.&quot;
</p>


<p>
It seems others have had similar issues

</p>


<p>
I resolved this by deleting this entry: 
</p>


<p><code>
<HostInterface/>  
</code></p>

<p>
from the config file, in my case this was 
</p>


<p><code>
.VirtualBox/Machines/WinXP/WinXP.xml
</code></p>

<p>
After this the virtual machine worked fine - and the new network settings are great.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
As well as following standards such as those laid down by www.w3.org I always try and test websites I develop across a range of browsers. Despite improvements in compatibility in recent years, browsers do still vary in implementation and even relatively minor browsers are still used by large numbers of people.
</p>


<p>
However all this testing can be hard to keep on top of and sometimes I just have to push out what seems like a small code change with only limited testing.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;m aiming to automate as much testing as possible, this is a little more work up front - but makes re-running tests trivial and so more likely to happen.
</p>


<p>
I use VirtualBox to run multiple environments, and am happy to find that the newer releases (2.1 and up) support improved networking.
</p>


<p>
So I have installed <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/remote-control/">Selenium RC</a> on a virtual machine, and by running this simple script I can test on Internet Explorer - from my Linux development machine.
</p>


<p>&lt;?php</p>

<p>set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . &lsquo;./PEAR/&rsquo;);
require_once &lsquo;Testing/Selenium.php&rsquo;;</p>

<p>$selenium = new Testing_Selenium(&ldquo;*iexplore&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>&rdquo;, &lsquo;192.168.0.7&rsquo;);</p>

<p>$selenium->start();</p>

<p>$selenium->open(&ldquo;/&rdquo;);
$selenium->type(&ldquo;q&rdquo;, &ldquo;hello world&rdquo;);
$selenium->click(&ldquo;btnG&rdquo;);
$selenium->waitForPageToLoad(10000);
print (preg_match(&ldquo;/Google Search/&rdquo;, $selenium->getTitle())) ? &ldquo;pass\n&rdquo; : &ldquo;fail\n&rdquo;;
$selenium->stop();</p>

<p>?></p>

<p>Note that I can specify which Virtual Machine to test on just by providing the appropriate IP address.</p>




<p>This example is in PHP because that&#8217;s what I use, it requires the Pear package Testing_Selenium which I installed on Ubuntu by the command</p>


<p><code>
sudo pear install channel://pear.php.net/Testing_Selenium-0.4.3
</code></p>

<p>
Now all I need to do is integrate this into my unit testing framework and add some scripts to start up and shut down the virtual machines.
</p>




<p>There is also Selenium Grid which is aimed at distributing tests across multiple machines in parallel - but as this is all running on one physical machine (my laptop) I don&#8217;t really want parallelisation here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I recently finished work on a project that really suffered from a lack of build tools.
</p>


<p>
It was a large project, and while many of us were keen on writing tests we weren&#8217;t able to get management sign of to spend some time automating the test process. So even though we did some of the work we didn&#8217;t get all the benefits.
</p>


<p>
It was really frustrating to come back to a piece of work that was well covered by unit tests, only to find those tests broken  
</p>


<p>
Well, right now I&#8217;ve decided to take some time to explore automated testing a bit more. I&#8217;ve got a Drupal site and a bunch of simpletest tests - I want the tests run on every commit, and while I&#8217;m at it I want to run some other checks too.
</p>


<p>
The following records what I&#8217;ve done so far, problems I encountered, and how I solved them.
</p>


<p>
Download 
</p>


<ul>
    <li><a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">cruisecontrol</a> <a href="http://phpundercontrol.org/about.html"><br />
    </a></li>
    <li><a href="http://phpundercontrol.org/about.html">phpundercontrol</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://demo.codesetter.com/drupal5-macgyver-cruisecontrol">simpletest runner for cruise control</a> (thanks Adnan)</li>
</ul>


<p>
Checkout and configure my Drupal site, create the settings for this as a CruiseControl project.
</p>


<p>
At this point I had CruiseControl setup, I could see my project, but no useful reports.
</p>


<p>
Debugging
</p>


<ul>
    <li>read the logfiles (doh!)</li>
    <li>run each process separately</li>
</ul>


<p>
CruiseControl is a big beast and trying to debug small parts of it by running it all wasn&#8217;t much fun.
</p>


<p>
CruiseControl runs each step of a build via <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</a>  - this is a fairly standard tool (available via apt-get if you&#8217;re a Debian user) 
</p>


<p>
Running ant manually gave me much greater visibility of errors that were occuring at this stage (I&#8217;d put my test runner script in the wrong place).
</p>


<p>$ cd cruisecontrol/projects/myproject
$ ant </p>

<p>
&nbsp;
</p>


<p>
This gives nice easy to read output for each step of the build.
</p>


<p>
Once CruiseControl has built your project it merges the xml logfiles; the merged file is stored in cruisecontrol/logs/myproject/
</p>


<p>
The web application part of CruiseControl uses xsl to transform these logfiles into output, and a little jsp to select which xsl files to use. Again I found it easier to debug the xsl part of the process by running the xsl manually (either on the combined logfile - or individual ones wrapped in &lt;cruisecontrol&gt; tags).
</p>


<p>$ xsltproc webapps/cruisecontrol/xsl/checkstyle.xsl  projects/myproject/build/logs/checkstyle.xml</p>

<p>
And what I found was that my xml log wasn&#8217;t xml after all (I&#8217;d hit a <a href="http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=14409">bug in phpcodesniffer</a> which was outputting error messages at the top of the file). 
</p>


<p>
Right now I have a continuous integration server up and running. It&#8217;s not quite how I want it yet but now I understand how CruiseControl works I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll take too long to get right - but it&#8217;s the sort of thing that I expect to grow and tweak as I go along.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ve found CruiseControl hard to setup, seen too many Java stacktraces, and blank screens when xsl didn&#8217;t work as expected.
</p>


<p>
Some things could probably be done better via svn commit hooks (if you have access to the svn server), and certainly it would have been faster to cobble together some cron jobs.
</p>


<p>
But I&#8217;ve persevered because CruiseControl comes with a wealth of plugins including many version control systems, and many notification methods. I&#8217;m hoping that I&#8217;ve overcome the initial learning curve and will start to reap the rewards.

<p>
I&#8217;ve been keen on building accessible websites for a long time, and I find everyone benefits from this - well developed accessible sites are just easier for everyone to use.
</p>


<p>
What&#8217;s great is that it can be as simple as just clearly defining the navigation areas of the site, or as complex as adding a semantic layer on top of a full application.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by git for a while, but as a long time user of svn I&rsquo;m kinda cautious about moving on.</p>

<p>So today I had some time and used it to read up on the pros and cons, as well as try things out a bit.</p>

<p>It seems to me that git is clearly the better system; but that svn has the advantage of maturity.</p>

<p>Git in itself seems to have grown up, it&rsquo;s just that the supporting infrastructure and developer experience is still limited.</p>

<p>But - where I think git has a huge advantage is they way that you an import projects from cvs or svn - keep the history and crucially to commit your changes back.</p>

<p>In the work I do with Drupal I&rsquo;ve found having my repository so separate from the central project to be frustrating.</p>

<p>What I hadn&rsquo;t realised before today is that git gives me the benefits of having a distributed version control system - without the central project (in this case Drupal) needing to change anything.</p>

<p>Linus has again created a wonderfully disruptive technology that puts more power in the hands of developers.</p>

<p>I cloned my git repository from git://github.com/mikl/drupal.git</p>

<p>It was so fast I thought it hadn&rsquo;t worked!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
The Drupal project I&#8217;ve been working on for the last year involved some fairly heavy file processing, with lot&#8217;s of validation.
</p>


<p>
To simplify the code I made extensive use of Exceptions, I didn&#8217;t create that many different Exception classes - but I made sure that any errors which affect the flow of the logic were handled by Exceptions.
</p>


<p>
This succeeded in making the code much more legible.
</p>


<p>
And now several months later I&#8217;m updating documentation - and it&#8217;s just great to be able to spot all the error handling code so easily.
</p>


<p>
It&#8217;s  a shame Drupal doesn&#8217;t use exception handling more in the core.

Phonegap is an open source compatibility layer for mobile development.

It provides access to common mobile functionality such as geolocation, sound, contacts etc via a JavaScript API

The idea is to make phone development more like web development, and to make deploying cross platform pas much easier.

This project looks to be in fairly early stages, but already very powerful.

<p>
In that same way that you can package up a java application into a single archive file (a jar) and run it directly from that file - you can now create a php archive file (a phar) !
</p>


<p>
Currently this has to be explicitly enabled, but will be standard in PHP 5.3
</p>


<p>
People often seem to forget that PHP works great on the command line, PHP is so prominent in website building that it is easy to see it as only for the web.
</p>


<p>
Hopefully this will help raise the profile of PHP for non web tasks :-)
