  <div class="entry-content"><p>
<a href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/docbook.html">Docbook</a> is a great standard for technical documentation, it is easily converted into a range of formats (html, pdf etc) and while it can be styled according to taste; the layout is always familiar.
</p>


<p>
When I first started using Linux you had to read a lot of documentation - and it was mostly in docbook format so I got kind of used to it.
</p>


<p>
But it&#8217;s a rich standard - making it much harder to learn than HTML.
</p>


<p>
And there don&#8217;t seem to be many good editors for it.
</p>


<dl>
<dt>OpenOffice</dt>
<dd>Templates available and can save as docbook - but for me it doesn&#8217;t produce valid documents</dd>
<dt>Lyx</dt>
<dd>This only ever supported a subset of the docbook standard, and whil it is quite nice to use docbook support seems to have faltered: it doesn&#8217;t work for me.</dd>
<dt>Quanta</dt>
<dd>The KDE web editor, provides some supportive utilities but is basically a syntax highlighted text editor in this role.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
and there are others&#8230;
</p>


<p>
http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookAuthoringTools 
</p>


<p>
But nothing that really grabbed me&#8230;
</p>


<p>
until I found
</p>


<p>
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-eclipse-docbook/index.html
</p>


<p>
I can use Eclipse to create the docs <img src="/sites/default/modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool" />
</p>


<p>
It&#8217;s not a WYSIWIG editor, but it does know which elements can go where 
</p>


<p>
<img src="/sites/default/files/u1/eclipse-docbook-gui.png" width="267" height="263" /> 
</p>


<p>
Which softens the learning curve a lot.
</p>


<p>
and it does validate the document for you 
</p>


<p>
<img src="/sites/default/files/u1/eclipse-docbook-validation.png" width="252" height="154" />
</p>


<p>
Meaning that when I create the output - it just works!
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ll post more when I&#8217;ve written some actual documentation.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I just got a new gadget - a mobile internet modem.
</p>


<p>
As ever the manufactures provide little support for us Linux users - but setup was pretty easy anyway.
</p>


<p>
I plugged it in and it was detected OK with full driver support.
</p>


<p>
Once installed it appears as any other modem would.
</p>


<p>
The only snag was that the Windows installer sets up it&#8217;s own modem setup and doesn&#8217;t give many clues what the configuration is!
</p>


<p>
A bit of googling later and I have a configuration file.
</p>


<pre>
[Dialer defaults]
Modem = /dev/ttyUSB1
[Dialer three]
Init2 = ATZ
Init3 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0
Stupid Mode = 1
Modem Type = Analog Modem
ISDN = 0
Phone = *99\#
Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
username = username
Password = password
Dial Command = ATDT
Baud =466600
Init4 = AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;three.co.uk&quot;
</pre>


<p>
see also http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=633981 
</p>


<p>
Now, I have to confess I don&#8217;t know what every line above does &#8230;
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;m using wvdial to make the connection and this insists on a username/password - but three don&#8217;t use one so just enter any value. The above is literally what I used.
</p>


<p>
The phone number is &#8216;*99#&#8217; (# is a comment in wvdial.con so has to be escaped)
</p>


<p>
The <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/threefiles/macdrivers/ConfigGuideUSBModemMac.pdf">Mac guide</a> was helpful - giving me the hint that three.co.uk was required in the init stages.
</p>


<p>
The Baud rate I took from a web post somewhere - I&#8217;ve tried tweaking it but the results are variable.  
</p>


<p>
Details for various services available from: 
</p>


<p>
<a href="http://www.knowyourmobile.com/info/1310/uk_mobile_operators_internet_and_email_settings.html">www.knowyourmobile.com/info/1310/uk_mobile_operators_internet_and_email_settings.html</a> 
</p>


<h2>Service Details</h2>


<p>
The connections is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT&#8217;ed</a> so wouldn&#8217;t be suitable for hosting services or running some games.
</p>


<p>
The service is filtered but not heavily - I can access ports for SSH, IMAPS, FTP.
</p>


<p>
All outgoing email (traffic to port 25) gets intercepted by three&#8217;s email servers, this could be useful but could cause problems if you think you are connecting to a specific mail server.
</p>


<p>
Three also provide an SMTP sever you can configure explicitly at smtp.three.co.uk 
</p>


<p>
I don&#8217;t see any signs of a transparent HTTP proxy.
</p>


<h2>Conclusion </h2>


<p>
I&#8217;m happy :-)
</p>


<p>
Connection speed reports at 1134Kbs up / 52 Kbs down - it&#8217;s noticably slower than my ADSL line but quite usable. 
</p>


<p>
I got this device primarily as a backup connection so that I can carry on working without interruption even if there is a local network problem. I also expect to be able to do the odd extra bit of work on the train or while away at weekends.
</p>


<p>
At £15 per month it won&#8217;t take a great deal of extra billable work before I&#8217;m making a profit! 
</p>


<h2>
It didn&#8217;t work on Windows 
</h2>


<p>
<img src="/sites/default/files/u1/doesnt-work-in-windows.gif" title="windows error message" width="348" height="147" />
</p>


<p>
I was dissapointed with the lack of Linux instructions for this device - but interestingly for me as a Linux advocate: installing the device didn&#8217;t work at all under windows!
</p>


<p>
Not only did instalation require a couple of reboots and install extra software on my machine - but then it wouldn&#8217;t connect. 
</p>


<p>
One more reason to love Linux <img src="/sites/default/modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool" />

This has just taken me a suprisingly long time to work out &#8230;
</p>


<p>
I needed to output a file with the follwing as a marker in various places.
</p>


<blockquote>
    ♦ U+2666 BLACK DIAMOND SUIT<br />
    <br />
    General Character Properties<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    C octal escaped UTF-8: \342\231\246<br />
    XML decimal entity: &amp;#9830;
</blockquote>


<p>
OK so I know the hex code I think I&#8217;ll just use <a href="http://uk.php.net/chr">chr()</a> but no&#8230; this only works for ASCII&#8230;
</p>




<p>&#8230;and the mbstring functions are great for working with multi-byte strings but don&#8217;t help enter them</p>




<p>
It turns out that you can either copy a literal ♦ into your source code - or use the <a href="http://uk.php.net/pack">pack()</a> function 
</p>


<p>&lt;?php
header(&lsquo;Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8&rsquo;);
echo &ldquo;♦\n&rdquo;;</p>

<p>echo pack(&ldquo;ccc&rdquo;, 0xE2, 0x99, 0xA6) .&ldquo;\n&rdquo;;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I&#8217;ve worked on a few internationalised sites in the past and it always raises challenges, Drupal makes some things easy - this post provides some simple tips for planning your translation process.
</p>


<p>
This advice is aimed at sizeable sites with formal release processes.
</p>




<!--break-->


<h2>General tips for any website translation project</h2>


<dl>
<dt>Plan</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is the key for any translation project, talk to all the people involved, make sure you know all the stages, and that everyone is comfortable that they can play their part.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Check your design</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A common problem with CMS driven websites is that the design if often produced by a designer more familiar with print layout (fixed amounts of content).
</p>
<p>
Translation makes this even more challenging, you have to really check that your design can cope with varying amount of content: compared to English: German words are long, Norwegian words very long - and Korean characters may need a larger font to be legible.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Introduce standards early</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Make sure the coding team are all doing things the same way - whatever the specifics for your project!
</p>
</dd> 
<dt>Translate late</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Wait as long as possible before starting on translation to ensure all phrases are finalised. It&#8217;s amazing how late in a project you can find whole extra pages that need writing - error pages especially; but all sorts of pieces of text get revised once you start testing.
</p>
<p>
Ideally I&#8217;d translate after testing is complete - and then test the translations separately.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Drupal Specific translation tips</h2>


<p></p>

<p>
Drupal provides the &#8216;t&#8217; function ( http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/5 ) which does a lot of work for you.
</p>


<p>
Generally, in Drupal you write code using literal strings that you want to appear as output but &#8216;wrap&#8217; them in the t function. This makes for readable code which hooks into the &#8216;translate strings&#8217; interface that Drupal provides.
</p>


<p>
When using the t function:
</p>


<dl>
<dt>
<br />
</dt><dt>
<p>
Don&#8217;t include leading or trailing whitespace in your strings - it&#8217;s really easy to miss and this mess up your layout (or if working with exported translation files to miss whitespace differences in the &#8216;original&#8217; language and find that your translations don&#8217;t appear).
</p>
</dt>
<dt>Consider using placeholder text</dt>
<dd>
<p>
(eg &#8216;ENTER_NAME&#8217; instead of &#8216;Enter name&#8217;) as your standard language.<br />
This may make for a slightly harder early proofing process but would make it easy to see which strings are translated, avoid problems with case sensitivity.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Don&#8217;t display the default text in any language</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If you&#8217;re running more than one language anyway it pays to &#8216;translate&#8217; English as well: this way you can easily override Drupal defaults.
</p>
</dd><dt>Don&#8217;t correct the spelling in your code</dt>
<dd>Following on from the point above - just update your translations which are in the database.<br />
This avoids updating your (thoroughly tested) code just to correct a typo.
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
</dd>
<dt>You can only translate a phase once.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
You can&#8217;t have an English word translated one way in one place and another way in another place - but if you use placeholder text you could use ENTER and USER_LOGIN_PAGE_ENTER
- translate both to &#8216;Enter&#8217; for the English locale and you&#8217;re still free to differentiate in other languages.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
Finally a quick note about the localiser module (http://drupal.org/project/localizer )
- this creates new nodes to hold translations - don&#8217;t forget to allow for this when planning your database schema. If your database constraints prevent duplication of some content you may end up with a broken schema.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s easy to save an Excel file as CSV and read it in PHP with the <a href="http://www.php.net/fgetcsv">fgetcsv</a> function but this may not work so well if the file contains non-English characters.</p>

<p>Excel uses a non-standard character encoding for csv files.</p>

<p>You can save an Excel file as &lsquo;unicode&rsquo; text however there are several unicode systems - Windows uses UTF-16, and PHP uses UTF-8.</p>

<p>To open the &lsquo;unicode text&rsquo; file in PHP you have to convert it, in addition you may want to be able to open UTF-8 files that may be created by other systems.</p>

<!--break-->


<p>PHP has an encoding detection function - but it can&rsquo;t detect UTF-16.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve solved the problem with the following function which detects from several encodings, adds an appropriate filter, and returns a filehandle which reads as UTF-8.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1238ffbd56db3b7c8d5b.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;?php

# http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/blog/2008/05/18/reading-a-unicode-excel-file-in-php/

function fopen_utf8($filename){
    $encoding='';
    $handle = fopen($filename, 'r');
    $bom = fread($handle, 2);
//  fclose($handle);
    rewind($handle);
    

    if($bom === chr(0xff).chr(0xfe)  || $bom === chr(0xfe).chr(0xff)){
            // UTF16 Byte Order Mark present
            $encoding = 'UTF-16';
    } else {
        $file_sample = fread($handle, 1000) + 'e'; //read first 1000 bytes
        // + e is a workaround for mb_string bug
        rewind($handle);
    
        $encoding = mb_detect_encoding($file_sample , 'UTF-8, UTF-7, ASCII, EUC-JP,SJIS, eucJP-win, SJIS-win, JIS, ISO-2022-JP');
    }
    if ($encoding){
        stream_filter_append($handle, 'convert.iconv.'.$encoding.'/UTF-8');
    }
    return  ($handle);
}

Using <a href="http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.pkg.html">doc-comments</a> in Eclipse really helps productivity by providing lots of tool-tip help and auto completion.
</p>


<p>
A colleague recently pointed out that Eclipse can auto-complete object properties (as long as you use the @property tag). I&#8217;ve found this really helpful and have been creating objects to return pass around - and found it a vwery neat way of working.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ve also been writing functions that may be used on the command line via <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">drush</a>, Drupal cron, or via pages.
</p>


<p>
A pleasant side effect of this is that the MVC pattern is starting to appear much clearer within Drupal. The Controller may be cron, drush, or the menu system, this calls the Model, and triggers a theme function for the View.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
With any sizeable project maintaining good documentation is a challenge - it&#8217;s all to easy to skimp on documentation, or to start with good intentions but allow the documentation to get out of date.
</p>


<p>
The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/api">Drupal API project</a> allows you to set up a documentation website for your project like <a href="http://api.drupal.org">api.drupal.org</a> that covers all your code.
<br />
The way this works is that you add doc comments to your code, and the Drupal API module extracts these to create the searchable and cross-referenced documentation.
</p>


<p>
Because doc comments are in the code it is easier to remember to update the documentation when you make a change.
To install the API module:
</p>


<ul>
    <li>Install Drupal</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
PracticalWeb is still a new venture for me; so far I&#8217;m really enjoying working more independently.
</p>


<p>
I find the relationship between client and contractor lends itself better to developing complex systems than that of employee/employer.<br />
 I haven&#8217;t entirely figured out why yet.
</p>


<p>
One potential downside is trying to do everything yourself, legal, accounting, invoicing, purchasing etc&#8230;
</p>


<p>
What I have found is that there are many helpful resources out there and by getting help where I can - I am better able to focus on my core work.
</p>


<p>
Chasing up late payment is something I especially dislike, and I find it very hard to make those persistent phone calls that can turn an invoice into cash.
</p>


<p>
My thanks to Sid at CreditSafe Ltd for diligently and politely resolving a late payment for me.
I was able to focus on work with my current client; and enjoy a relaxed weeks holiday.

When developing a website it&#8217;s important to test it in as many different web browsers as possible. 
</p>


<p>
If a client has a problem viewing the page there&#8217;s little point saying &quot;but it works on my machine&quot;
</p>


<p>
 
I have found that the differences between different versions of firefox to be small enough that testing in one version is sufficient.
</p>


<p>
Internet Explorer is so different between versions that each target version must be tested seperately.
</p>


<p>
There is a <a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">package for multiple IEs</a>.
</p>


<p>
But you can&#8217;t then install the developer toolbar, and I&#8217;m not quite convinced that install is 100% the same as having a standard browser.
</p>


<p>
Fortunately Microsoft are aware of the problem and make a test virtual machine available.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ve used this for a while for testing IE6 - and it works very well.
They have now released a verion of IE8 - time to check that my websites won&#8217;t break when users start updating.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I&#8217;ve recently been working with AJAX and SOAP which both result in multiple sessions running concurrently.
</p>


<p>
For example if you have an AJAX progress bar for a large file upload one session is uploading the file while a series of shorter sessions check on progress and update the bar.
</p>


<p>
How to track both parts of this cleanly has had me scratching my head a bit - but the solution is fiendishly simple.
</p>


<p>
It turns out that there is a buried configuration setting in Eclipse (my IDE of choice) which allows you to debug multiple sessions.
</p>


<p>
in Eclipse go to:
</p>


<p>
Window | Preferences &#8230; | PHP | Debug | Installed Debuggers | XDebug | Configure
</p>


<p>
Then check the box that says &#8216;Use Multisession&#8217;
</p>


<p>
<img src="/sites/default/files/multisession.png" alt="screenshot" />
</p>


<p>
Lo and Behold the debug pane now has a multisession manager and allows you to see what is happening on both sessions.
