  <div class="entry-content"><p>
PracticalWeb is still a new venture for me; so far I&#8217;m really enjoying working more independently.
</p>


<p>
I find the relationship between client and contractor lends itself better to developing complex systems than that of employee/employer.<br />
 I haven&#8217;t entirely figured out why yet.
</p>


<p>
One potential downside is trying to do everything yourself, legal, accounting, invoicing, purchasing etc&#8230;
</p>


<p>
What I have found is that there are many helpful resources out there and by getting help where I can - I am better able to focus on my core work.
</p>


<p>
Chasing up late payment is something I especially dislike, and I find it very hard to make those persistent phone calls that can turn an invoice into cash.
</p>


<p>
My thanks to Sid at CreditSafe Ltd for diligently and politely resolving a late payment for me.
I was able to focus on work with my current client; and enjoy a relaxed weeks holiday.

When developing a website it&#8217;s important to test it in as many different web browsers as possible. 
</p>


<p>
If a client has a problem viewing the page there&#8217;s little point saying &quot;but it works on my machine&quot;
</p>


<p>
 
I have found that the differences between different versions of firefox to be small enough that testing in one version is sufficient.
</p>


<p>
Internet Explorer is so different between versions that each target version must be tested seperately.
</p>


<p>
There is a <a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">package for multiple IEs</a>.
</p>


<p>
But you can&#8217;t then install the developer toolbar, and I&#8217;m not quite convinced that install is 100% the same as having a standard browser.
</p>


<p>
Fortunately Microsoft are aware of the problem and make a test virtual machine available.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ve used this for a while for testing IE6 - and it works very well.
They have now released a verion of IE8 - time to check that my websites won&#8217;t break when users start updating.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I&#8217;ve recently been working with AJAX and SOAP which both result in multiple sessions running concurrently.
</p>


<p>
For example if you have an AJAX progress bar for a large file upload one session is uploading the file while a series of shorter sessions check on progress and update the bar.
</p>


<p>
How to track both parts of this cleanly has had me scratching my head a bit - but the solution is fiendishly simple.
</p>


<p>
It turns out that there is a buried configuration setting in Eclipse (my IDE of choice) which allows you to debug multiple sessions.
</p>


<p>
in Eclipse go to:
</p>


<p>
Window | Preferences &#8230; | PHP | Debug | Installed Debuggers | XDebug | Configure
</p>


<p>
Then check the box that says &#8216;Use Multisession&#8217;
</p>


<p>
<img src="/sites/default/files/multisession.png" alt="screenshot" />
</p>


<p>
Lo and Behold the debug pane now has a multisession manager and allows you to see what is happening on both sessions.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Any complex website that needs updating has to be tested without affecting the users of the live site.
</p>


<p>
The challenge then is how to replicate the changes made on your test site on the live site.
</p>


<p>
If all the changes are in code then version control systems such as svn and cvs solve this problem very neatly. 
</p>


<p>
But with a CMS such as Drupal some changes are inevitably required in the database. 
</p>


<p>
Managing these changes without affecting the site content can be tricky.
</p>


<p>
This isn&#8217;t just a Drupal problem - I&#8217;ve encountered in on most web applications and CMS&#8217;s I have worked on.
</p>


<p>
My current solution is based on very careful documentation of the database changes - but I&#8217;m always on the lookout for more automated solutions.

Three useful Threads on Drupal:

    </li>
</ul>


<p>
There is also a macro recording facility in the devel module
http://drupal.org/project/devel
</p>


<p>
Also interesting is this work calculating the dependency diagram for Drupal modules

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
One of the problems I have encountered while developing for Drupal on a laptop is how to test the sending of emails.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ve recently come across two solutions.
</p>


<h3>
Devel Module 
</h3>


<p>
This helpful module includes a mail wrapper function which directs all mail to the Drupal logs, perfect for testing volume mail sending or just for getting a password reset link.
</p>


<p>
http://drupal.org/project/devel
</p>


<h3>SSH tunnels</h3>


<p>
This is probably a more specialist solution - but I&#8217;ve recently been using an SSH tunnel to allow me to send and receive email through a firewall. As a bonus this means that all mail on localhost port 25 is redirected to my mailserver and PHP mail functions Just Work
</p>


<p>ssh example.com -L 25:localhost:25</p>

I’ve just upgraded to firefox 3 beta and it looks pretty cool
</p>
<p>
I got my plugins working by following these steps
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open about:config in the address bar.</li>
    <li>Right click on the list and create a boolean: extensions.checkCompatibility</li>
    <li>Set its value to false.</li>
    <li>Restart browser.</li>

Firebug works in FF3 even withgout this step if you get the latest beta from here<br />

I’ve just spent ages trying to find out why I couldn’t add some default views to drupal
</p>
<p>
I’d set up my views, exported them added them to a module in a hook_views_default_views() function…
</p>
<p>
and nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
First I though this was caching - but much cache clearing and debugging later…
</p>
<p>
I realised that if the view requires categories that don’t exist -
it just gets silently dropped - no error - no warning it just doesn’t
work!!!
</p>
<p>
This seems to be a general Drupal thing - all too often failures are silent - and very hard to track down.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>really interesting thread on the Drupal consultants mailing list</p>

<div class="post-entry">
<p>
especially of note:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    <a href="http://lists.drupal.org/pipermail/consulting/2008-January/002324.html">http://lists.drupal.org/pipermail/consulting/2008-January/002324.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    We work primarily with educational entities and non-profits; in our line<br />
    of work the fear of competition comes up infrequently, but it still<br />
    comes up –
    </p>
    <p>
    WRT Alan’s question re posting our dev agreement — we spent a fair<br />
    amount of time and money working through this with our lawyers — the<br />
    resulting document is tied pretty closely to our business model and our<br />
    work with educators and non-profits.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the core, though, the section in question — and this is the section<br />
    that has been very useful to us — makes the following distinctions —<br />
    and IANAL so these distinctions are a layperson’s distinctions, and<br />
    should not be confused with the writings of a person who actually knows<br />
    anything about the topic :-) 
    </p>
    <p>
    Client pre-existing IP: specialized information/knowledge that the<br />
    client has developed<br />
    Developer pre-existing IP: specialized information/knowledge that we<br />
    have developed<br />
    Project IP: work that results from Client and Developer coming together<br />
    to solve the client’s specific needs. For us, this is often a blurry<br />
    line, as we are frequently approached by clients to help them<br />
    articulate, and then solve, the specific issues within their organization.<br />
    Custom Code: Any code we write belongs to the client as work for hire<br />
    License Back: the client agrees to grant us a perpetual, royalty free<br />
    license, as governed by a non-compete clause (ie, we don’t copy the<br />
    client’s business plan — for us, this isn’t generally an issue, as we<br />
    work with non-profits and schools)<br />
    GPL: Custom code is licensed under the GPL, and will be released back to<br />
    the community under terms negotiated b/w Client and Developer
    </p>
    <p>
    The key elements are the different types of IP, and how the code is<br />
    owned and licensed. By clearly stating that we develop GPL code, we have<br />
    the conversation up front, which allows us to avoid any<br />
    misunderstandings re licensing.
    </p>
    <p>
    The one exception we make is themes/graphic identity. The branding<br />
    always remains the property of the client.<br />
    &gt;<br />
    &gt;&gt;<br />
    &gt;&gt;     I was a consultant for over 4 years and never under any<br />
    &gt;&gt;     circumstances would we be allowed to reuse a solution built for<br />
    &gt;&gt;     one client for another client.  We were expensive, however, the<br />
    &gt;&gt;     client kept everything always.<br />
    &gt;<br />
    This is possible in theory, but, IMO, more difficult in practice — once<br />
    you know how to do something, you can’t un-know it. As a recent example,<br />
    we worked out some publishing workflows on a community writing site we<br />
    developed this summer. The process was unique to the client, as it met<br />
    their specific internal needs. On a site we brought live this fall, we<br />
    used some of the same principles to support an online grant application<br />
    and review process. To somebody looking strictly at the technical<br />
    solution, it would look amazingly similar, despite the complete<br />
    differences in context. Part of the reason we have the license-back<br />
    clause in our contract is to protect us against any misunderstanding<br />
    here — the fact that we have experience is a good thing. Again, I think<br />
    I’m missing something wrt the original comment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Cheers,
    </p>

<p>
Running on Debian Etch I had to upgrade the NUT package but this
worked very simply by bringing in the one from Lenny (in testing)
</p>
<p>
added to /etc/apt/sources.list<br />
deb-src http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/ lenny main contrib non-free
</p>
<p>
then ran<br />
apt-get build-dep nut
</p>
<p>
as normal user<br />
apt-get source nut<br />
cd to nut dir<br />
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b
</p>
<p>
then as root installed the .deb created 
</p>
<p>
After that it was just a case of reading the docs and configuring.
</p>
<p>
I’m using the UPS for my desktop and monitor - it’s drawing 25% load
with a predicted battery runtime of about 45minutes (which I don’t
quite believe)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve just had cause to restore a two year old backup of a database I haven’t used in a while</p>

<div class="post-entry">
<p>
Since then postgresql (on Debian at least) has added the option to
have multiple ‘clusters’ and multple versions running on the same
machine.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the old version (7.4) was still available<br />
</p>
<p>
Steps
</p>
<ul>
    <li>restore /var/lib/postgresql/data</li>
    <li>restore /etc/postgresql</li>
    <li>mkdir /var/lib/postgresql/7.4</li>
    <li>mv /var/lib/postgresql/data /var/lib/postgresql/7.4/</li>
    <li>chown -R postgres.postgres  /var/lib/postgresql/7.4/</li>
    <li>pg_createcluster 7.4 data (this moves the old data into the new structure)</li>
    <li>pg_upgradecluster 7.4 data (upgrade the data to the latest postgres version installed)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other issues: my old data was in a character set I didn’t have installed as I now use UTF8
</p>
<p>
I had to add en_GB ISO-8859-1 to /etc/locale.gen
</p>
<p>
and run locale-gen
</p>
<p>
But I now have access to my old data in both old and new server
versions (I’ll probably delete the old one but it might be useful for
testing)
