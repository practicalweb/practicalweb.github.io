    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Graphite is a highly scalable real-time graphing system.</p></blockquote>

<p>It took me a while to realise but the data input to graphite is <em>incredibly</em> simple</p>

<p>The message input format is just</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>metric_path value timestamp\n
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>So for example, "foo.bar.baz 42 74857843"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Wow: just a label the number you want to store and the timestamp it relates to.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really basic, there is nothing there about what kind of data it is, no difference between something you want to count (say page hits) and a number you want to average (like load)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/blob/master/docs/graphite.md">Configuring Graphite for StatsD</a> is a <em>very</em> important doc to read if you want to use these tools together.</p>

<p>The default config in graphite keeps data at 1 minute resolution for 1 day <strong>and then discards it</strong> and if you are sending data to graphite every 10 seconds graphite has to figure out how to convert 6 data points (or some nulls and some data) to 1 data point for the minute.</p>

<p>You really need the statsd specific config to ensure counts are not averaged and infrequent data is not dropped.</p>

<p>I needed to install on Centos using just official and EPEL packages, I wanted to use collected to gather system metrics and while version 5 can log direct to graphite version 4 ships with Centos 6.5 and that can&rsquo;t log direct.</p>

<p>In any case I wanted to use statsd to allow easy logging of custom data from production code, the original written by etsy is a node service and probably doesn&rsquo;t run with stock packages on Centos,</p>

<p>Centos does provide a python-bucky package which acts both as a statsd server and as a bridge to collectd.</p>

<p>The full list of packages I needed is</p>

<ul>
<li>graphite-web</li>
<li>graphite-web-selinux</li>
<li>python-carbon</li>
<li>python-whisper</li>
<li>collectd</li>
<li>python-bucky</li>
</ul>

<p>Statsd caught me out with a debug mode that <em>only</em> prints to stdout and doesn&rsquo;t actually log any data to graphite, I expected debug mode to print out data in addition to regular duties.</p>

<p>I did need to make statsd listen on all networks instead of just localhost, and still need to wrap it properly as a service.</p>

<p>Edit collectd.conf to enable the plugins you want, the only problem I had here was collectd silently dying if I had a config error.</p>

<p>You need to setup an initial graphite users database</p>

<p><code>`bash
/usr/bin/python /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/graphite/manage.py syncdb
</code></p>

<p>Another useful post <a href="https://kevinmccarthy.org/blog/2013/07/18/10-things-i-learned-deploying-graphite/">https://kevinmccarthy.org/blog/2013/07/18/10-things-i-learned-deploying-graphite/</a></p>

<p>Writing this up now it all seems quite simple - but I haven&rsquo;t really found it so, I think the main problem has been understanding what graphite is actually doing, and not taking the trouble to optimise that config as a first step.</p>

    <id>http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/blog/2014/11/19/grafana</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with some new toys.</p>

<p>What motivated me was a desire to be better able to interpret load test data and performance metrics.</p>

<p>I love graphs, for me the visualisation they provide allows me to recognise patterns and figure out cause/effects massively faster than any other way.</p>

<p>In the past I&rsquo;ve mainly relied on Munin which is very easy to setup, and I&rsquo;ve even customised graphs. My most successful case was when two servers in a pool of four kept falling down, by graphing apache hits per second and severer load for all for servers on the same page - it provided convincing proof that the two servers which fell down did so under no extra load and at the exact same moment. It later turned out these two were VMs on the same host OS which was having previously unnoticed problems.</p>

<p>This visualisation transformed a conversation from one of what could or couldn&rsquo;t be wrong to acceptance and how to fix it.</p>

<p>But with Munin I had to define the graph and then collect the data - I had to wait for another outage.</p>

<p>I wanted to be able to compose graphs on the fly to test hypotheses with existing data - grab the data now and define the graphs to visualise what I want to see after the fact.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://play.grafana.org/">Grafana</a> I just love this tool, it allows me to compose graphs entirely on the fly, mixing and matching any data I want on the same graph, or multiple graphs on the same page.</p>

<p>With the <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.timeShift">timeshift</a> function I can even put say this weeks and last weeks data on the same graph for easy comparison.</p>

<p>I hope to work on some screenshots and maybe screencaps - the tool is so interactive it&rsquo;s hard to explain - for now go an play with it.</p>

<p>Grafana works by calling the json API of graphite-web, one thing that threw me at first was the <a href="http://grafana.org/docs/#graphite-&amp;-elasticsearch-setup-example">initial config example</a></p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure which server component I was meant to be connecting to on 8080, this is just the regular graphite-web service from apache - in my case on port 80.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that <a href="graphite%20cannot%20exist%20in%20a%20subdirctory">https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/issues/223</a> at least not for the version I am running.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reviewing security and realised I&rsquo;ve been relying too much on my routers firewall - which isn&rsquo;t even present if I work on an open wifi connection somewhere.</p>

<p>Steps so far</p>

<p>Reinstalled Ubuntu with full disk encryption, apart from the need to back and restore data this was a painless process. I don&rsquo;t see a noticeable performance impact (though I have a fast system with SSD) the biggest drawback I can see is that if I mess around with a custom kernel and break the boot sequence - I don&rsquo;t know if I can boot from a live CD to fix it.</p>

<p>Setup a restrictive local firewall</p>

<p>as root</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>edit /etc/postfix/main.cf</p>

<p>set</p>

<p>inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1</p>

<p>and <code>/etc/init.d/postfix restart</code></p>

<p>I will review open ports each time I configure a new service and ensure I don&rsquo;t have services I only need local accessible externally.</p>

<p>By both configuring firewall <strong>and</strong> limiting services I am applying the principle of defence in depth and even if there is a weakness (or I make a mistake) in one place I will still be protected.</p>

<p>Where I do need to share services between systems on my home/office network I have realised my old router is not sophisticated enough and am purchasing one that can separate secure and insecure networks.</p>

<p>All systems are now being configured for automatic updates, since I want patches as soon as possible, small frequent updates are easier to debug than problems with large updates, and generally I only delay updating out of inertia rather than any deliberate action. This way I don&rsquo;t even have to think about it.</p>

<p>Also set /root/.forward to ensure I get root mail</p>

<p>I have also realised I rely too much on browser stored passwords, and while this is useful for low-security logins I will not be using it for any important site.</p>

<p>Funnily I&rsquo;ve also found I needed to revisit my backup policy and actually delete more stuff <strong>not</strong> backing up code and documents which are business confidential and are already backed up centrally. In this case I realised my own backups were just causing a data management problem just increasing the risk that the data gets accidentally disclosed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Drupal has been in the new today for all the wrong reasons</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29846539">Millions of websites hit by Drupal hack attack</a></p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/10/drupal-sites-had-hours-to-patch-before-attacks-started/">Drupal sites had “hours” to patch before attacks started</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2841372/drupal-if-you-werent-quick-to-patch-assume-your-site-was-hacked.html">Drupal users: Assume your site was hacked if you didn&rsquo;t apply Oct. 15 patch immediately</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/10/30/did-drupal-drop-the-ball-users-who-didnt-update-within-7-hours-should-assume-theyve-been-hacked/">Did Drupal Drop The Ball? Users Who Didn&rsquo;t Update Within 7 Hours &lsquo;Should Assume They&rsquo;ve Been Hacked&rsquo;</a></p>

<p>The biggest headache for me was the Public Service Announcement <a href="https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003">https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003</a> which is clearly written to alarm users into updating.</p>

<p>We did update our clients site - within 24 hours which at the time seemed pretty good considering the timezones and chaneg control processes involved.</p>

<p>Fortunately we also reload our entire database and other content on each deploy - so even though we took longer than 7 hours to update we consider we are pretty safe (never say 100%) and beyond that we have a lot of other security in place.</p>

<p>However I find myself wondering what else we could have done.</p>

<p>I wish we had a member on the drupal security team - that seems to have helped some people.</p>

<p>I see now there were a couple of (low key) advance notices <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/445893">https://groups.drupal.org/node/445893</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/drupalsecurity/status/522128826101669888">https://twitter.com/drupalsecurity/status/522128826101669888</a></p>

<p>I will try to pay better attention to those in the future, but we may also have to enhance our out of hours work, the security annoucment came in at the end of the day - perhaps we will ahve to work overnight another time to review, test, and help the client upgrade.</p>

<p>Hopefully good will come from the thread at <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/447468">Follow up Drupageddon responsibly</a></p>

<p>Drupal will need to learn and grow from this.</p>

    <link href="http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/blog/2014/10/28/creating-new-vagrant-base-boxes-with-veewee/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-28T16:08:14+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/blog/2014/10/28/creating-new-vagrant-base-boxes-with-veewee</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Creating your own base box for vagrant is a great thing to do, you get to undestand exactly what is on that box and to choose exactly what base OS you use.</p>

<p>After all one of the big draws of vagrant is keeping your dev environment close to what production looks like - and for that you need to know what is in the base box.</p>

<p>When I first started using vagrant I wrote a post <a href="http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/blog/2012/10/16/how-to-build-a-centos-6-base-box-for-vagrant/">How to build a Centos 6 base Box for vagrant</a> whcih details the manual steps needed. At the time I was busy learning puppet, vagrant and related tools - veewee was just one tool too many and a manual build seemed the best way to get my head around what a base box was.</p>

<p>While the base box isn&rsquo;t something I have needed to repeat much, it is beneficial to update the base image from time to time and here veewee is brilliant. It also makes shareing the reponnsbibility for the base box within a team easy.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I did</p>

<ul>
<li>fork <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee</a> (in my case to a private repo)</li>
<li>check that out</li>
<li>install veewee according to its install notes</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>veewee vbox tenplates <span class="p">|</span> grep -i centos
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This told me that the template I wanted was CentOS-6.5-x86_64-minimal</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>veewee vbox define centos65 CentOS-6.5-x86_64-minimal
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now I made some edits to customise the base box how I wanted</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>vim definitions/centos65/definition.rb <span class="c"># comment out the chef line</span>
</span><span class='line'>vim definitions/centos65/cleanup.sh <span class="c"># remove build packages like gcc</span>
</span><span class='line'>vim definitions/centos65/vagrant.sh <span class="c"># remove insecure vagrant key and add your own public key</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Build</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>veewee vbox build centos65
</span><span class='line'>veewee vbox <span class="nb">export </span>centos65
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>add to my local vagrant so I can test</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>vagrant box add centos65 ./centos65.box
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now I can copy the base box to a team-accessible server</p>

<p>And push my custom definition to my veewee fork so anyone from the team can build an updated box.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>vim .gitignore <span class="c"># remove definitions/*</span>
</span><span class='line'>git add .gitignore
</span><span class='line'>git add definitions/
</span><span class='line'>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;added my definition&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>git push

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> is a fork of <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/">kibana</a> that builds grapshs based on data stored in <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">graphite</a> (it can pull data from other places too but this blog only looks at graphite)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking at using it to replace tools like [munin}(<a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">http://munin-monitoring.org/</a>) or [cacti}(<a href="http://www.cacti.net/">http://www.cacti.net/</a>) which do a great job of gathering and displaying metrics.</p>

<p>Wwhat Grafana does beyond this is that it allows you to interactivley manipulate the graphs, you can easily create a graph showing related metrics on the same screen (for example add sysem load and apache requestes per second to the same graphic). You can do this in the other tools - but you have to edit config files on the server, in grafana this is all managed via the UI.</p>

<p>It also allows you to look at any period you like - and in any resolution.</p>

<p>sudo yum install graphite-web python-carbon</p>

    <id>http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/blog/2014/10/21/migrating-from-drupal-5-to-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been running this blog (or some version of it) for almost 10 years now.</p>

<p>I write to help clarify my own thoughts, or to note down technical details of a task that I have struggled to figure out. I often found myself coming back and have saved many hours of trying to figure out the same thing again a year or more later.</p>

<p>For a long time this site was running Drupal 5, I set it up at a time when I was getting to know Drupal, starting out as an independant, and had plenty of time to spend on it. At the time this was a very useful excercise, installing lots of modules, and writing some code was good experience. But when Drupal 6 came out and I was busy <a href="http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/blog/2008/07/18/time-to-upgrade-to-drupal-6}">it wasnt worth upgrading</a>, then when drupal 7 was released and Drupal 5 no longer supported, upgrading was even more difficult as I would have had to upgrade in two steps. Besides Drupal didn&rsquo;t seem like such a good fit for my blog any more.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have to apply security updates on a site I&rsquo;m not getting paid for: so a static html site is a great fit for me.</p>

<p>I lose integrated comments, but spam had already killed those for me - I&rsquo;ll try disqus and see how that goes (the need to enable comments in the yaml for each post threw me at first).</p>

<p>Search was useful - but I can grep the source files myself.</p>

<p>I had all sorts of Drupal plugins before - but really I don&rsquo;t think they were very important.</p>

<p>Jekyll seems great, especially because with github&rsquo;s patronage it seems unlikely to become unsupported; and at the end of the day it is just a bunch of simple files so importing to another system should be easy.</p>

<p>Exporting from Drupal 5 needed a <a href="https://github.com/practicalweb/jekyll-import/commit/cfa72281147fd37ce527d2dab1f3ae916e066b04">small patch on the importer</a> without this the categories were seen as some kind of binary object in yaml. The import reads direct from the database, so doesn&rsquo;t run all Drupal&rsquo;s filters and I suspect a drupal export module from drupal would do a much better job. I still need to pull over some old comments and formatting could do with a tidy up, but I need to move to a system that gets me writing new content, and not worry too much about the old.</p>

<p>Jekyll itself didn&rsquo;t use tags in the way I wanted - I find the ability to cross link from one post to similar ones very useful so I am using Octopress which seem to do what I want out of the box.</p>

<p>To get the content in Octopress I just did</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cp jekyll/mysite/_posts/* octopress/source/_posts
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I have switched from pygments highlighter to linguist (this seems to be what github use and supports code highlighting well)</p>

<p>I added a twitter aside for which I just copy pasted the twitter widget into <code>source/_includes/asides/twitter.html</code> and enabled this in _config.yml</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a ruby coder, so instaling all the required ruby gems and figuring out how to run a modified version of the jekyll importer took a little while, in the end I think it was just a case of getting all the gems installed that I needed. I didn&rsquo;t blog soon enough!</p>

<p>Then rsync to the server and use mod rewrite to retain the paged links like frontpage?page=4</p>

<p>Some bugs have a nasty habit of only occurring in production, this may be due to high load, odd/old browsers, changes in data, or just because test scenarios don’t cover every eventuality.</p>

<p>What this means is that when we have a bug in production we can only understand it through the error logging we have already built into the system. If we need to put in place additional logging we usually lose the chance of actually fixing the bug for another release cycle.</p>

<p>One of the real arts in this flow of development is to be pessimistic enough to assume that somehow something is going to go wrong, to remember that the people who see the bug will not be the developers who know the code, and that at this point (unlike during dev) we will have very limited access to the systems we might want to debug.</p>

<p>One temptation is to log everything - but you soon find that doesn’t scale.</p>

<p>The art of error messages is a bit like the art of commenting - especially for those errors that should never happen. You often don’t need to say exactly what went wrong, hopefully your compiler or runtime engine will do this along with a stacktrace or at least a line number. You need to say what it means to have this error - especially if it indicates a breakdown in business logic. It also helps to raise errors as early in the code flow as possible.</p>

<p>When working on a large project with multiple teams it is especially helpful for errors to make clear whenever possible which team the bug belongs to. Clear error data like this can really cut down on the politics that can accompany a production bug and radically reduce the time to fix.</p>

<p>For example let’s imagine that we are developing a website, we are responsible for the shopfront but we obtain product data from a feed. As well as all the bugs that can occur in our code there are likely to be a whole host of possible problems with the incoming data.</p>

<p>What if we receive a null instead of the agreed object, what if the price is non numeric (or zero, or negative), what if an expected field is missing?</p>

<p>You might display a product with zero price, fail to display it, or perhaps you do catch an error but the log just says something like “Notice:  Trying to get property of non-object”. The bug gets reported to the front end team - because that’s where the error appears. The front end team can’t see the production data.</p>

<p>The politics here is that teams often blame each other, developers are generally optimistic that their code is good and pessimistic about other teams code. Therefore bugs get thrown over the wall too quick and then get thrown back - leaving bugs bouncing about with no fix.</p>

<p>Now imagine you have explicit validation at the point you load third party data (or any place you have a boundary of responsibility like this). You log an error that points directly to the data feed, hopefully with the actual data that is wrong, perhaps even logging the request/response pair that led to it. This time you can give the data team enough info that they can quickly identify the problem. Conversely if you have missing products and no data errors - the impossible has happened - there is a bug in your own code. Now you get to be the hero and fix it.</p>

<p>Remember, in development (where developers spend 95%) of their time this bug would be trivial, the developer would see the error, know which bit of code it related to, be able to view the data feed, and report the bug back to the data team. The trick is to remember it won’t be like this in production.</p>

<p>In my experience it is well worth spending a chunk of time up front writing good generic error routines, that capture as much detail as possible, and 5 or 10 minutes every day looking at stubbed out error routines.</p>

<p>This may add up to a non-trivial time investment - but you only have to save a few minor production bugs to get paid back plenty.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a gmail account, you get a google plus account with it, many of end of with several of each. For mail this is usually what you want but for plus with it&#8217;s circles you usually just want one account and to split post by circle. Fortunately there is a way to redirect one account to another.</p>




<p>This way anyone looking for you at the account you don&#8217;t really use or looking you up via an alternate email  gets redirected to your active account.</p>




<p>First make sure you are only logged in to the google account you want to transfer your connections away from</p>




<p>Go to <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/takeout/custom">Google takeout</a>, this is usually used to download backups of your data.</p>




<p>On the google circles line is a little folder icon, the mousover text tells you this is to &quot;Transfer your google+ connections to another account&quot;</p>




<p>Follow this link and you&#8217;ll have to log into your destination account.</p>




<p>That should set up your transfer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To use google plus comments on your site all you need to do is insert the following code on teh page where you want the comments to appear</p>

<p>url should be the full url to the page, then any comments in google plus with this url will appear to any user who can see them (ie public commnts or those from people in the viewers circles).</p>

<p>width is just how wide you want the comment box</p>

<p>BLOGGER This method is as far as I can see only officially supported for Blogger comments and only this value seems to work</p>

<p>FILTERED_POSTMOD similarly seems to be just what people use - I didn&rsquo;t find docs for this so I&rsquo;m unsure if other values work</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I was notified by my ISP that my server was &quot;emitting a UDP-based denial of service attack &quot;, as a result the VM had been rebooted and taken off the network.</p>




<p>With console access I was able to verify there was a problem, and the ISP was able to give me a clean VM, with my old system available as a mount, in read-only mode</p>




<p>I had thought that the server was fairly well locked down with minimal users, secure passwords and so on, but to be honest with other commitments I hadn&#8217;t been keeping on top of patching.</p>




<p>Reviewing logs etc didn&#8217;t show any clear point of entry, and since the server was rebooted I didn&#8217;t see any  ongoing activity. I decided the best thing is just a clean rebuild, with better security, better monitoring, and keep on top of those patches.</p>




<p>The site is back up - but the code is based on Drupal 5 which isn&#8217;t supported and I don&#8217;t have time for an upgrade right now. What I&#8217;ve done is to run the site  locally (after audit) and put online a static html mirror. As well as leaving less avenue for attack this should make the site a lot faster to load. I keep meaning to revamp the site properly but just never seem to have time, and there are always paid tasks that take priority!</p>




<p>Comments are the main loss - but they were overloaded with spam anyway - so I&#8217;m trying out google plus comments instead which I hope will avoid the spam and give a better experience</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I used to use subversion and <a href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py">svnmerge</a> a lot, and there&#8217;s just one thing I miss about it. Now svnmerge is a tool to bolt on merge tracking to svn, and gits merge tracking is vastly better in many ways. But the one thing that svnmerge allowed me to do that was cool and doesn&#8217;t have a real equivalent in git is to block commits</p>




<p>I use release branches as well as feature branches, so for each release we support we have a barcnh, new features are developed in feature branches off this - and merged back to it when complete. The branch for release x gets merged forwards to release x+1 periodically - to ensure that any features or bugfixes make it to the latest release.</p>




<p>Sometimes we make a commit to an older release that we don&#8217;t want to merge forwards to newer releases - typically this is a quick and dirty bugfix/workaround that is superseded by a proper fix in the next release.</p>




<p>Svnmerge allowed you to &quot;block&quot; these commits so that they did not get merged forwards, with git you could cherry-pick around these commits - but you&#8217;d loose the ability to do regular merges.</p>




<p><p>What you can do it git is to merge the commit - but keep the files unchanged, this looks a bit weird but works OK.<p></p>

<p><code>git cherry-pick -e &ndash;strategy=ours $hash</code></p>

<p><p>The strategy=ours bit means keep the code as it was in this branch. -e lets you edit the commit message to indicate it isn&rsquo;t a normal merge</p></p>

<p><p>Now sometimes this doesn&rsquo;t seem to work, git complains that the commit is empty, I think this is when there is a conflict - in this case the only way I have worked around it is to do a regular cherry-pick and resolve the conflict manually - effectively undoing the commit. Then <code>commit &ndash;allow-empty</code></p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/github/github-services/pull/604M/">this pull request</a> which led me to look at the API</p>

<p>useful docs</p>

<p>What I found was that this just replaces my jenkins hook - which isn&rsquo;t what I wanted.</p>

<p>But the more I looked at the service hooks the more it looked like the jenkins one just passes a standard payload to a url, which is the same as the generic webhook, so I tried adding the jenkins webhook URL as a standard webhook ( you are allowed multiples of these) and that seems to work.</p>
