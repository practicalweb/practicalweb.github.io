    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been using Puppet for a little while and am now working on a project that will be using RedHat&#8217;s Satellite (the upstream project is Spacewalk).</p>




<p>I haven&#8217;t really used puppet in anger on production systems yet, I&#8217;m referring to the open source edition of Puppet, and have only read about Satellite, but I didn&#8217;t find much comparison out there so thought it worth writing up what I&#8217;ve found.</p>




<p><p>They key differences that strike me are<p></p>

<p><ul>
<li>Satellite is RedHat/Centos only, Puppet works on multiple distributions, and even on Windows to some extent</li>
<li>Satellite is primarily a GUI driven system whereas Puppet is primarily text configuration (puppet has a web dashboard but it&rsquo;s really just a log viewer)</li></p>

<p><li>Satellite can manage provisioning of new systems (I&rsquo;m using openstack for provisioning new VMs anyway, Razor is said to work well with Puppet for provisioning)</li></p>

<p><li>Satellite manages configuration via simple templates with limited variable use, Puppets templates are fully scriptable</li></p>

<p><li>Puppet has a very rich dependency system (eg you can trigger an Apache restart whenever a configuration change occurs</li></p>

<p><li>Satellite uses a mixture of technologies (python, Java, C) puppet is written in Ruby.</li></p>

<p><li>Puppet is available as a package on Ubuntu/debian systems, on Redhat/centos it has to be installed via the EPEL repo, pulling in extra dependencies</li></p>

<p></ul></p>

<p><p>Personally I much prefer puppet&rsquo;s approach, it&rsquo;s easy to keep all the config in git and test changes in a dev env before rolling out.</p></p>

<p><p>I love puppets declarative approach, and the ability to chain dependencies</p></p>

<p><p>That said I&rsquo;m really looking forward to playing with Satellite, finding out how provisioning works when all the servers are VMs and seeing how we manage the dependency tracking</p></p>
