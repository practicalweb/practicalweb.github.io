I&#8217;m working on an AJAX heavy site for a defined audience who all have JavaScript - so I have a form with no submit button that gets submitted by an change handler. 
</p>


<p>
Normally I&#8217;d make sure the site was fully accessible - but not on this project so I just got rid of the submit button. I got the JavaScript submit working only to find my Drupal form no longer worked.
</p>


<p>
It seems that the Drupal submit handlers are not called if the form doesn&#8217;t have a submit button. I can&#8217;t see any reference to this in the Drupal API, but adding theÂ  button back in and hiding it via CSS works fine.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I&#8217;ve recently been working with AJAX and SOAP which both result in multiple sessions running concurrently.
</p>


<p>
For example if you have an AJAX progress bar for a large file upload one session is uploading the file while a series of shorter sessions check on progress and update the bar.
</p>


<p>
How to track both parts of this cleanly has had me scratching my head a bit - but the solution is fiendishly simple.
</p>


<p>
It turns out that there is a buried configuration setting in Eclipse (my IDE of choice) which allows you to debug multiple sessions.
</p>


<p>
in Eclipse go to:
</p>


<p>
Window | Preferences &#8230; | PHP | Debug | Installed Debuggers | XDebug | Configure
</p>


<p>
Then check the box that says &#8216;Use Multisession&#8217;
</p>


<p>
<img src="http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/sites/default/files/multisession.png" alt="screenshot" />
</p>


<p>
Lo and Behold the debug pane now has a multisession manager and allows you to see what is happening on both sessions.
