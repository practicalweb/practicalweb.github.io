    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have just got the new gphone, the G1 which is a collaborative venture: google provide the OS, HTC make the hardware, T-Mobile provide the netwwork, and loads of software is written by many people - and made available via Google marketplace.</p>

<p>While a few things feel a little beta still; on the whole it all hangs together very well indeed.</p>

<p>First of all it&rsquo;s worth saying the actual phone works very well, something all too easily overlooked.</p>

<p>The rest of the gadgets work great - well enogh for me to write this on the bus.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Having just upgraded to Ubuntu 8.10 my key observation is that it&#8217;s important to read the release notes first.
</p>


<p>
http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/810
</p>


<p>
There are a few bugs which have affected me
</p>


<ul>
    <li>there is no bluetooth support in KDE</li>
    <li>my wifi card only works in the US<br />
    (there&#8217;s a workaround and I&#8217;m back online)</li>
    <li>Â Dual head display with xrandr is causing problems<br />
    (my screen flashes and KDE is putting widgets in parts of the screen I can&#8217;t see)</li>
    <li>Subversion has moved to version 1.5 and getting Eclipse to use a compatible svn library is proving tricky</li>
</ul>


<p>
On the plus side KDE 4.1 is looking very pretty, and the move to subversion 1.5 will be very useful in the long run.
</p>


<p>
I had hoped to get my 3G connection working as a previous update seems to have broken it - but so far still no joy. 
</p>


<p>
update:<br />
There&#8217;s a solution for the Kubuntu Intrepid Dual Monitor Blinking<br />
issue here: http://blog.nixternal.com/2008.10.22/kubuntu-intrepid-dual-monitor-blinking/

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three are definately putting a transparent proxy between me and the network.</p>

<p>I just got this error message</p>

<blockquote>
Network Error (tcp_error)

<p>Which isn&rsquo;t coming from my web browser (which has a different error page for this problem).</p>

<p>And it isn&rsquo;t coming from the remote server as the message is that it couldn&rsquo;t connect!</p>

<!--break-->


<p>This is most definately filtering.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written a small script that outputs text after a couple of minutes. Over a normal ADSL connection it works fine.</p>

<p>But over three&rsquo;s network I get the following results</p>

<p>(using telnet to ensure there is no other program in the way)</p>

<p><code></p>
