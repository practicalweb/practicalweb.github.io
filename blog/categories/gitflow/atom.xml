    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I&#8217;ve been looking into <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/">gitflow</a> recently, it&#8217;s an interesting set of scripts to facilitate <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">a succesful git branching model</a> which some of the people I work with rave about.
</p>


<p>
In the end I&#8217;ve decided I don&#8217;t like the tool or the model, though both are interesting.
</p>


<p>
I think this is because I&#8217;m used to working in fairly large teams where we may have some people working on one release and others working on the next, in this situation I want release branches that are fairly long lived, and to create topic branches from them.
</p>


<p>
In fact in one project we dropped the master branch altogether and just used a series or release barnches, always merging the older release branches into the newer (further from launch) ones. 
</p>


<p>
The other main reason is that gitflow hides some of the mechanics of git in a way that seems to me to hinder peoples understanding of what they are doing, it&#8217;s a shame it down&#8217;t output the git commands it uses - that would allow people to use it to get started then move on later if they want.
</p>


<p>
The commands also seem very slow to me which is odd when you are used to git being fast.
</p>


<p>
Documentation on gitflow seems sparse, with some commands incomplete (git flow support * , gitflow feature checkout)
</p>


<p>
 The best I could find is the source, and particularly the &quot;summary&quot; bits
</p>


<p>
 <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/blob/develop/git-flow-release#L177">https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/blob/develop/git-flow-release#L177</a>
</p>


<p>
The project wiki does have some addiutional info on command line options
