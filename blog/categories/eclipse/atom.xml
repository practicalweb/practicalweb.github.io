<pre>
cd .metadata/.plugins
mv org.eclipse.core.resources org.eclipse.core.resources.bak
Start eclipse. (It should show an error message or an empty workspace because no project is found.)
Close all open editors tabs.
Exit eclipse.
rm -rf org.eclipse.core.resources (Delete the newly created directory.)
mv org.eclipse.core.resources.bak/ org.eclipse.core.resources (Restore the original directory.)
Start eclipse and start working. :-)

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve worked on a project which is providing as well as consuming web services.</p>

<p>In this case I need to debug incoming requests that are not initiated from with the browser (I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://www.soapui.org/">soapui</a> as a test tool).</p>

<p>In order to allow Eclipse to pick up xdebug responses triggered by requests from soapui I just needed to</p>

<ul>
<li>start a debuging session within eclipse as normal</li>
<li>ensure that the query string ?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=ECLIPSE_DBGP is appended to all requests by editing the WSDL file so that the address looks like
<code>
<soap:address location="http://dev.example.com/soap_server.php?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=ECLIPSE_DBGP"/>
</code>
</li>

<li>make requests via soapui</li>
</ul>


<p>Now eclipse is picking up the soap requests and I can step through as normal (some tools apply a timeout which can be a nuisance while debugging - I haven&rsquo;t been using soapui long enough yet to see if that&rsquo;s the case here)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
xdebug is an immensely powerful tool for exploring what your code really does.
</p>


<p>
You can get a long way using print_r  but ultimately this always requires that you predict the path your code will take - and the tricky bit about debugging is you need it when your predications have gone wrong.
</p>


<p>
It&#8217;s generally pretty easy to set up
</p>


<ul>
    <li> install the php5-xdebug package</li>
    <li>check that the Eclipse PHP preferences have xdebug as an option</li>
    <li>if you&#8217;re debugging locally the default settings should be OK</li>
    <li>create a site configuration in the debug dialog</li>
    <li>set a break point</li>
    <li>start debugging</li>
</ul>


<p>
If it doesn&#8217;t work at first restart Eclipse
</p>


<p>
Check that you have a browser configured in Eclipse
</p>


<p>
Not all settings seem to be picked up immediately

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>
Version conflicts to be aware of
</h2>


<p>
Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) now ships with Subversion 1.5 
</p>


<p>
You can&#8217;t use a svn 1.4 client and a svn 1.5 client on the same working copy.
</p>


<p>
While the subversion integration in Eclipse is great I still prefer to do some things on the command line and some with kdesvn.
</p>


<p>
Then you need to upgrade your subclipse plugin to subclipse 1.4
</p>


<p>
If you can - then upgrade to Eclipse 3.4 
</p>


<p>
But Eclipse 3.4 doesn&#8217;t run the latest stable version of PDT - and last time I tried to use an Integration build it was unusable - I may try again sometime but right now I want a small upgrade.
</p>


<p>
I followed this instructions here http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html
</p>


<p>
But Eclipse reported a &quot;Network problem&quot;
</p>


<p>
So I downloaded the zip file<br />
http://subclipse.tigris.org/files/documents/906/43792/site-1.4.5.zip
</p>


<p>
Unpacked it in a folder on my local webserver, pointed Eclipse at this location and the installation worked!
</p>


<p>
Phew - I have a working Eclipse for PHP development on Ubuntu 8.10 
</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Having just upgraded to Ubuntu 8.10 my key observation is that it&#8217;s important to read the release notes first.
</p>


<p>
http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/810
</p>


<p>
There are a few bugs which have affected me
</p>


<ul>
    <li>there is no bluetooth support in KDE</li>
    <li>my wifi card only works in the US<br />
    (there&#8217;s a workaround and I&#8217;m back online)</li>
    <li> Dual head display with xrandr is causing problems<br />
    (my screen flashes and KDE is putting widgets in parts of the screen I can&#8217;t see)</li>
    <li>Subversion has moved to version 1.5 and getting Eclipse to use a compatible svn library is proving tricky</li>
</ul>


<p>
On the plus side KDE 4.1 is looking very pretty, and the move to subversion 1.5 will be very useful in the long run.
</p>


<p>
I had hoped to get my 3G connection working as a previous update seems to have broken it - but so far still no joy. 
</p>


<p>
update:<br />
There&#8217;s a solution for the Kubuntu Intrepid Dual Monitor Blinking<br />
issue here: http://blog.nixternal.com/2008.10.22/kubuntu-intrepid-dual-monitor-blinking/
