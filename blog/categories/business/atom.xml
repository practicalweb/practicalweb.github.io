    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
PracticalWeb is still a new venture for me; so far I&#8217;m really enjoying working more independently.
</p>


<p>
I find the relationship between client and contractor lends itself better to developing complex systems than that of employee/employer.<br />
 I haven&#8217;t entirely figured out why yet.
</p>


<p>
One potential downside is trying to do everything yourself, legal, accounting, invoicing, purchasing etc&#8230;
</p>


<p>
What I have found is that there are many helpful resources out there and by getting help where I can - I am better able to focus on my core work.
</p>


<p>
Chasing up late payment is something I especially dislike, and I find it very hard to make those persistent phone calls that can turn an invoice into cash.
</p>


<p>
My thanks to Sid at CreditSafe Ltd for diligently and politely resolving a late payment for me.
I was able to focus on work with my current client; and enjoy a relaxed weeks holiday.
