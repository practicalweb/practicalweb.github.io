    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve long been puzzled by the <a href="http://drupal.org/upgrade/downloading-drupal-gui">official advice on upgrading Drupal</a></p>


<p></p>

<p>It basically says you should delete everything, unpack a new Drupal version, and replace your customisations.</p>




<p>I like to use version control to manage my site.</p>




<p>My current project uses the pressflow fork of Drupal, I downloaded the current and new versions of this, added them to my repository and then upgrading my working copy is as easy as</p>


<p><code>
svn merge &ndash;ignore-ancestry <a href="https://example.com/svn/vendor/pressflow-6.15.73">https://example.com/svn/vendor/pressflow-6.15.73</a> <a href="https://example.com/svn/vendor/pressflow-6.16.77">https://example.com/svn/vendor/pressflow-6.16.77</a> ./
</code></p>

<p>This merges in all the changes (including file/directory additions/deletes).</p>




<p>Then I play around with the newly upgraded site, have a look at the code that changed, check all is OK and when I&#8217;m happy - commit the changes.</p>




<p>If I later find a bug that might be related to an upgrade I&#8217;ve got the changes ready via the usual tools (annotate, log, diff).</p>




<p>Even better - this retains any changes I&#8217;ve made to core without any need to keep a list of patches. If the core update contains a fix I&#8217;ve applied locally then I&#8217;ll get a conflict which I can resolve.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Debian Etch has been serving me well for a few years with wonderfully easy and infrequent maintenance.</p>

<p>However it&rsquo;s at the end of its life</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100121">http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100121</a></p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve upgraded to Lenny following these instructions</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html">http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html</a></p>

<p>It was remarkably painless</p>

<p>One small problem with the mail system.</p>

<p><code>
Errors were encountered while processing:
 exim4-config
 imapproxy
 exim4-base
 exim4-daemon-light
 courier-imap
 at
 bsd-mailx
 courier-imap-ssl
 mailx
</code></p>

<p>But scrolling upwards I got a more helpful error message</p>

<p><code>
A package failed to install.  Trying to recover:
Setting up exim4-config (4.69-9) &hellip;
DEBCONFsomethingDEBCONF found in exim configuration. This is most probably
caused by you upgrading to exim4 4.67-3 or later without accepting the
suggested conffile changes. Please read
/usr/share/doc/exim4-config/NEWS.Debian.gz for 4.67-2 and 4.67-4
</code></p>

<p>So I purged exim, deleted the config files, reinstalled it and now everything seems good.</p>
