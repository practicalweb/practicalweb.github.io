    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of blogs about this already - but I didn&rsquo;t quite understand at first so here&rsquo;s my take &hellip;</p>

<p>Wireshark is a large and somewhat vulnerable program - best not to run it as root (especially as you may be looking a suspicious traffic)</p>

<p>It uses dumpcap for the actual packet capture which is the only bit that needs elevated privileges.</p>

<p>Since linux kernel 2.2 we don&rsquo;t even need root for this bit - we can set file permissions to allow non root user to capture packets.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to allow just any user on your system to do this first make sure only a chosen group can even run dumpcap</p>

<p>I decided to use the sudo group - but you could make a new one.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">sudo chgrp sudo /usr/bin/dumpcap
sudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/dumpcap
</code></pre>

<p>Now only members of the sudo group (who are already the users I trust) can run this program.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/bin/dumpcap
</code></pre>

<p>This allows the program to gain elevated network rights without being run by root.</p>

<p>Note that any chmod action seems to undo the setcap so perform the changes in this order.</p>

<p>Now I can run wireshark as my regular user and have full functionality.</p>
