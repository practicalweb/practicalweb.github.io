    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I have far too many books, both technical and diversionary, I read a great deal online, and still find myself printing a lot out: so I&#8217;ve been interested in the new generation of ereaders.
</p>


<p>
The devices seem pretty good, certainly the text is very clear, capacity and battery life are reportedly great.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ve tried out the open source project <a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/">caliber</a> which can convert various formats into ebook format.
</p>


<p>
But it seems these books only really display text well, I wasn&#8217;t at all happy with the results of converting from A4 PDF documents (from O&#8217;Reilly books) the resulting pages were terribly laid out.
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;m also very suprised to find books to be more expensive electronically.
</p>


<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Temporal-Void-Trilogy/dp/1405088834/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1228726290&amp;sr=8-1">Hardback book £11.39</a> or pay <a href="http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/displayProductDetails.do?sku=6515084">£15.90 for the ebook</a> 
</p>


<p>
The e-ink technology looks great - I look forward to larger devices with better ability to display tables and fonts.
</p>


<p>
In the meantime I&#8217;m sticking with books, printouts, and my laptop.
