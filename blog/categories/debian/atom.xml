I&#8217;ve just spent too long being very confused as to why varnish wasn&#8217;t working
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;d forgotten that&nbsp; the Debian version doesn&#8217;t read the default.vcl config file by default!
</p>


<p>
You have to edit /etc/default/varnish and specify the config type you want.
</p>


<p>
I was getting the error message
</p>


<p><code>
Error 503 Service Unavailable</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Debian Etch has been serving me well for a few years with wonderfully easy and infrequent maintenance.</p>

<p>However it&rsquo;s at the end of its life</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100121">http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100121</a></p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve upgraded to Lenny following these instructions</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html">http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html</a></p>

<p>It was remarkably painless</p>

<p>One small problem with the mail system.</p>

<p><code>
Errors were encountered while processing:
 exim4-config
 imapproxy
 exim4-base
 exim4-daemon-light
 courier-imap
 at
 bsd-mailx
 courier-imap-ssl
 mailx
</code></p>

<p>But scrolling upwards I got a more helpful error message</p>

<p><code>
A package failed to install.  Trying to recover:
Setting up exim4-config (4.69-9) &hellip;
DEBCONFsomethingDEBCONF found in exim configuration. This is most probably
caused by you upgrading to exim4 4.67-3 or later without accepting the
suggested conffile changes. Please read
/usr/share/doc/exim4-config/NEWS.Debian.gz for 4.67-2 and 4.67-4
</code></p>

<p>So I purged exim, deleted the config files, reinstalled it and now everything seems good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I recently bought a Sony e-reader, the main Linux package to support this is calibre but I found that it wouldn&#8217;t automatically sync my ebooks.
</p>


<p>
 <a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/user_manual/faq.html#what-devices-does-app-support">The FAQ says </a>
</p>


<p>
 &quot;The linux kernel can export two version of SYSFS, one of which is deprecated.&quot;
</p>


<p>
Apparently Debian Lenny exports the deprecated version and you have to recompile the kernel to undo this.
</p>


<p>
I wanted to make the minimum change possible to my system and continue using the packaging system : I follwed roughly the following steps:
</p>


<p><code>
sudo aptitude install kernel-package ncurses-dev fakeroot wget bzip2 linux-source-2.6.26
mkdir ~/linux
cd ~/linux
tar -xjf /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.26.tar.bz2
cd linux-source-2.6.26
cp /boot/config-2.6.26-2-686 .config
make menuconfig
</code></p>

<p><p>
In the config menu I selected
<pre>
General setup &ndash;>
         [] Create deprecated sysfs layout for older userspace tools
</pre>
<p>And made sure I specified a custom revision to differentiate my custom package from the standard one</p></p>

<p><code>
make-kpkg &ndash;rootcmd fakeroot &ndash;initrd &ndash;revision=custom.001 kernel_image kernel_headers
cd ..
sudo dpkg -i linux*deb
</code></p>

<p><p>Then reboot ensuring the new kernel is loaded.</p></p>

<p><p>I meant to write this up as I went but I&rsquo;m doing it a few days later so please take care if following them - and adjust to suit your kernel version etc.<p></p>

<p><p>The above sounds like a pain but was actually fairly easy, and calibre is much better than the official Sony software which I tried on a Windows machine but it was slow and kept crashing.</p></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Debian has a very strict policy on free and legal software. This helps keep everyone honest, but sometimes a pragmatic approach is called for. MP3 is a file format that is patent encumbered - but also in universal use. 
</p>


<p>
I could use the supplied Ogg Vorbis tools but then my music wouldn&#8217;t work everywhere I want it to.
</p>


<p>
So I want to install Lame which is only available in source.
</p>


<p>
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lame/files/
</p>


<p>
Download and extract 
</p>


<p><code>
cd lame-398-2/</p>

<h1>install a build environment by pulling in the build dependencies for something useful (I chose php)</h1>

<p>sudo apt-get build-dep php5
sudo aptitude install fakeroot</p>

<h1>check build dependencies of lame</h1>

<p>cat debian/control</p>

<h1>and install them</h1>

<p>sudo aptitude install nasm libsndfile1-dev
chmod 700 debian/rules
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b
sudo dpkg -i ../lame_3.98.1_i386.deb ../libmp3lame0_3.98.1_i386.deb

    <updated>2009-07-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I&#8217;ve just installed Debian Lenny and generally am impressed with how well things are auto detected and configured - so much easier than a few years ago - and in many ways easier than a Windows install where you have to constantly find 3rd party drivers to get things working.
</p>


<p>
 However getting wifi running was a bit trickier (largely because of FCC regulations  affecting licenses and default settings).
</p>


<p>
This document got me most of the way 
</p>


<p>
http://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi
</p>


<p>
Additional lines in /etc/.network/interfaces
</p>


<p><code>
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  pre-up ip link set wlan0 up
  wpa-driver wext
  wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</p>

<p></code></p>

<p>and wpa_supplicant.conf looks like
<code>
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant</p>

<p>network={
     ssid=&ldquo;mynetwork&rdquo;
     psk=&ldquo;mypassword&rdquo;
}
</code></p>

<p>And it&#8217;s all working&#8230;</p>




<p>
This old bug seems to be fixed
