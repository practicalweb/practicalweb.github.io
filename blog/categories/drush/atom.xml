    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reading <a href="http://www.drupaler.co.uk/users/gregharvey">Greg</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.drupaler.co.uk/blog/security-releases-dont-work/504">post on security upgrades</a> and a few mentions of patches in the following discussion got me thinking about upgrade methods.</p>

<p>The standard Drupal method is to delete existing files and unpack a tarball to replace the old version - I find this method unappealing because: I keep my code in subversion so don&rsquo;t want to delete the .svn subdirectories, and sometimes I have patches applied that I don&rsquo;t want to loose.</p>

<p>Drush provides a significant step up for managing updates, it&rsquo;s really easy to use and replaces just files not the directory structure so it plays well with subversion.</p>

<p>So I had a look around for methods to upgrade Drupal via patches (I really don&rsquo;t understand why this isn&rsquo;t the default) and I found</p>

<p>A whole lot of ready made patches
<a href="http://fuerstnet.de/en/drupal-upgrade-easier">http://fuerstnet.de/en/drupal-upgrade-easier</a></p>

<p>A handbook page about patch upgrades
<a href="http://drupal.org/node/359234">http://drupal.org/node/359234</a></p>

<p>And a script to generate patch files
<a href="http://2bits.com/articles/upgrading-drupal-5-2-installations-to-5-3-security-releases-using-a-single-patch.html">http://2bits.com/articles/upgrading-drupal-5-2-installations-to-5-3-security-releases-using-a-single-patch.html</a></p>

<p>Which is really cool - but all aimed at core - so I&rsquo;ve created a modified version which also works for modules (attached)</p>

<p>The main advantage of this method is that when patches have been applied to a live site but these patches haven&rsquo;t been accepted upstream - then it is still easy to upgrade to new releases - and should the patch later be accepted upstream the new release will generate a patch conflict alerting you to the relevant changes - and allowing you to choose how to proceed.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend this technique for newbies, for most people drush updates are the way to go.</p>

<p>But if you find yourself maintaining patches on core or contrib modules that aren&rsquo;t moving through the issue queue - then maybe this may be helpful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The drush script which provides comman line acceess to drupal functionality emits an error message when run as a cron job</p>


<p><code>
tput: No value for $TERM and no -T specified
</code></p>

<p><code></p>

<h1>If it is not exported determine and export the number of columns.</h1>

<p>if [ -z $COLUMNS ]; then
  export COLUMNS=$(tput cols)
fi
</code></p>

<p>I presume drush uses this information to calculate layout of output.</p>




<p>However when running as a cron job COLUMNS is not set and tput gives the above error.</p>




<p>To resolve this specify a COLUMNS value in your cron job, setting an appropriate size for viewing in email</p>


<p></p>

<p><p>cron now runs the following for me.</p>

<p><code></p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>cd /var/www/mysite/public_html</p>

<p>COLUMNS=80 /home/me/bin/drush cron
</code></p>

Drupal has a fairly easy to meet set of requirements http://drupal.org/node/502452 
</p>


<p>
But Drupal projects are free to set their own rules in this area and Drush has used functions only available in PHP 5.2 - as far as I can see this is just the json functions.
</p>


<p>
Frustratingly the latest version of RedHat provides PHP 5.1 and this is the second time I&#8217;ve run into the problem with a client who uses RedHat and understandably wants to stick to the standard packages.
</p>


<p>
Drush provides command line access to Drupal functions and so is incredibly useful - but not quite critical enough for a platform re-evaluation. 
</p>


<p>
Since my project was using a JSON class anyway I decided to get Drush working using this class instead of requiring PHP 5.1Â
