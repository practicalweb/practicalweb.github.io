    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To convert data from munin/rrd to graphite/whisper you need to use the <code>rrdwhisper</code> tool which in centos is part of the python-whisper package.</p>

<p>If you want to change the data retention/resolution properties in graphite you will also need to resize the files as well.</p>

<p>Note that Graphites reads from /etc/carbon/storage-aggregation.conf and /etc/carbon/storage-schemas.conf to select the retention and aggregation policies for <em>new</em> data, but since these are set in the file at creation time editing the config file has no effect on existing files (or those created with whisper2rrd).</p>

<p>Recent data is stored at 10 second intervals, when it becomes older 6 lots of 10 second data get aggregated to make a one minute interval. I think this aggregation also happens on newer data if I select say data for the last 2 days since this time period include data at the lower resolution - all the data I get is at this lower resolution.</p>

<p>When this data is aggregated it can be averaged; in my case I&rsquo;m measuring how long something takes - and average is right. But say I was counting something then I&rsquo;d want to know the total over a minute - sum - not average, and if I was recording peaks then I&rsquo;d want the max.</p>

<p>The xFilesFactor as I understand it tells graphite to ignore all the data for an interval if there are too many nulls, but since my original data is at a lower resolution I have loads of nulls and don&rsquo;t want to ignore anything - so I&rsquo;m setting this to zero and my import seems to work well at different scales and on both old and new data.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
for rrd in *rrd ; do 
    rrd2whisper --xFilesFactor=0.0 --aggregationMethod=average $rrd
    whisper-resize  --xFilesFactor=0.0 --aggregationMethod=average --nobackup ${rrd%.rrd}_42.wsp   10s:6h 1min:6d 10min:1800d  
done


[ -d /var/lib/carbon/whisper/munin ] || sudo -u carbon mkdir -p /var/lib/carbon/whisper/munin
sudo mv *wsp /var/lib/carbon/whisper/munin
sudo chown -R carbon:carbon  /var/lib/carbon/whisper/munin
</code></pre>

<p>This script excerpt deals with the basic conversion - I also needed to convert the long filenames munin used to a nested directory structure used by graphite.</p>

<p>That conversion will depend on your use case - if you look at the files stored under /var/lib/carbon/whisper and /var/lib/munin you should be able to see the pattern.</p>
