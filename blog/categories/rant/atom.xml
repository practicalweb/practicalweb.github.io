    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I&#8217;ve had an account with O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari books</a> on and off for years
</p>


<p>
I&#8217;ve cancelled it before beacuase of design issues that rendered it unworkable for me.
</p>


<p>
This time they have &quot;upgraded&quot; the site from an AJAX based layout which allowed me to choose between &quot;print fidelity&quot; and &quot;HTML view&quot;.
</p>


<p>
The new layout uses Flash to render the pages as they look in print in a scrollable window.
</p>


<p>
I hate this because
</p>


<ul>
    <li>I work on a widescreen laptop with development toolbars and tabs in my browser - this layout of a tall thin view just doesn&#8217;t fit on my screen.</li>
    <li>I can&#8217;t scroll the Safari menu and banner offscreen </li>
    <li>Most of the time I don&#8217;t care too much about formatting I just want to read it and HTML is easier to read</li>
    <li>The scrolling doesn&#8217;t respond to my mousewheel</li>
    <li>I like to get a nice big page of text onscreen and the use the browsers search to quickly home in on the bit I want to read. </li>
</ul>


<p>Oh well - back to books for now and another incentive to try and get the perfect ereader&hellip;</p>
